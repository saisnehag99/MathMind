On the behavior of $F$-thresholds with respect to the fibers of blow-ups and $F$-rationality,2025-11-06 18:21:57+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04625v1,"We establish a general inequality comparing the $F$-thresholds of a local
ring and its associated graded ring. As an application, we deduce that the
$F$-rationality of the graded ring descends to the local ring.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04625v1,2511.04625v1,AG
Torsor and Quotient Presentations for $D$-homogeneous Spectra,2025-11-06 18:19:16+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04624v1,"The $D$-graded Proj construction provides a general framework for
constructing schemes from rings graded by finitely generated abelian groups
$D$, yet its properties and applications remain underdeveloped compared to the
classical $\mathbb{N}$-graded case. This paper establishes the essential
characteristics of $D$-graded rings $S$, like the distinction between
$D$-homogeneous prime ideals and $D$-prime ideals if $D$ has torsion. We
particularly focus on describing the quotient by the associated group scheme,
generalizing the construction of a toric variety from its Cox ring. As in the
$\mathbb{N}$-graded construction, the basic affine opens of the Proj
construction are given in terms of degree-zero localizations $S_{(f)}$, where
$f$ in $S$ homogeneous is \emph{relevant}. We prove that $\pi_f: {\rm
Spec}(S_f) \to {\rm Spec}(S_{(f)})$ is a geometric quotient under mild
finiteness assumptions if $f$ is relevant, and give necessary and sufficient
conditions for this map to be a pseudo ${\rm Spec}(S_0[D])$-torsor.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04624v1,2511.04624v1,AG
Uniform irreducibility of Galois action on the $\ell$-primary part of Abelian $3$-folds of Picard type,2025-11-06 18:00:14+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04609v1,"Half a century ago Manin showed that given a number field $k$ and a rational

imaginary quadratic field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04609v1,2511.04609v1,AG
Moduli space of connections on a irregular rational curve,2025-11-06 17:16:28+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04561v1,"We study the compactification of the moduli space of a certain class of
rank-two irregular connections on the Riemann sphere, presenting one double
pole and two simple poles. To explicitely build the compactification, we
identify a class of irregular connections with an irregular rational curve and
an extra complex parameter. As a first step, we will inspire to the Deligne and
Mumford's work to compactify the moduli space of such irregular rational
curves, introducing the notion of irregular stable nodal curve. Secondly, we
will understand the behaviour of the extra complex parameter to conclude the
compactification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04561v1,2511.04561v1,AG
The cyclic open--closed map and variations of Hodge structures,2025-11-06 16:18:51+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04498v1,"We construct the cyclic open--closed map for the big (i.e., bulk-deformed)
relative Fukaya category, in the semipositive case, and show that it is a
morphism of `polarized variations of semi-infinite Hodge structures'. We also
give a natural criterion for the map to be an isomorphism, which is verified
for example in the context of Batyrev mirror pairs. We conclude in such
Calabi-Yau cases that the rational Gromov--Witten invariants can be extracted
from the relative Fukaya category, and hence that enumerative mirror symmetry
is a consequence of homological mirror symmetry for Calabi--Yau mirror pairs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04498v1,2511.04498v1,AG

Hyperbolicity and fundamental groups of complex quasi-projective varieties (I): Maximal quasi-Albanese dimension by Nevanlinna theory,2025-11-06 14:31:26+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04405v1,"This is the first part of a series of three papers. In this paper, we

ramification and $X$ is a complex quasi-projective variety of log-general type

Quantum Entanglement as a Cohomological Obstruction,2025-11-06 12:55:28+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04326v1,"We recast quantum entanglement as a cohomological obstruction to
reconstructing a global quantum state from locally compatible information. We
address this by considering presheaf cohomologies of states and entanglement
witnesses. Sheafification erases the global-from-local signature while leaving
within-patch multipartite structure, captured by local entanglement groups
introduced here. For smooth parameter families, the obstruction admits a
differential-geometric representative obtained by pairing an appropriate
witness field with the curvature of a natural unitary connection on the
associated bundle of amplitudes. We also introduce a Quantum Entanglement Index
(QEI) as an index-theoretic invariant of entangled states and explain its
behavior. Finally, we outline a theoretical physics approach to probe these
ideas in quantum many-body systems and suggest a possible entanglement-induced
correction as an experimental target.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04326v1,2511.04326v1,AG
Inversion of the Abel--Prym map for real curves with involutions,2025-11-06 10:03:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04229v1,"Riemann vanishing theorem is a main ingredient of the conventional technique
related to the Jacobi inversion problem. In the case of curves with a
holomorphic involution, it has been exhaustively expounded in wellknown Fay's
Lectures on theta functions. The case of real algebraic curves with involution
is presented with less completeness in the literature. We give a detailed
presentation of that case, including real curves of non-separating type (with
involution) not considered before with this relation. We obtain the
Novikov--Veselov realness conditions in a different set-up.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04229v1,2511.04229v1,AG
Schemes of Objects in Abelian Categories,2025-11-06 08:50:43+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04191v1,"In the article Categorical Construction of Schemes, arXiv:2511.03433 we gave

localization of a ring in a maximal ideal is a local representation of the
corresponding function field. In this text, we replace the category of rings
with a general locally small category $\cat C$, we consider a subcategory $\cat

study non-K\""ahler case. We show that the Kuranishi space of a pair $(M,E)$ of
a complex parallelizable nilmanifold $M$ and its trivial holomorphic vector
bundle $E$ is isomorphic to the direct product of the Kuranishi space of $M$

An orthogonal perspective on Gauss composition,2025-11-06 02:17:47+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03987v1,"We revisit Gauss composition over a general base scheme, with a focus on
orthogonal groups. We show that the Clifford and norm functors provide a
discriminant-preserving equivalence of categories between binary quadratic
modules and pseudoregular modules over quadratic algebras. This perspective
synthesizes the constructions of Kneser and Wood, reconciling algebraic and
geometric approaches and clarifying the role of orientations and the natural
emergence of narrow class groups. As an application, we restrict to lattices

iterated sequences for the Grassmannian $\operatorname{Gr} (3, n)$ as a special

weighting matrix $M_{S}$ corresponding to a valuation on the rational
coordinate ring and we show that the initial form of a Pl\""{u}cker relation

the cones $C_S$ in the tropical Grassmannian that satisfy
$\operatorname{in}_{M_S} (\mathcal{I}_{3,n}) = \operatorname{in}_{C_S}

Rational normal curves as no-$(d+2)$-on-$Q$-quadric sets,2025-11-05 15:01:31+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03526v1,"For every $d\geq 2$, we construct a subset $D\subseteq \{1,2,\dots,n\}^d$ of
size $n-o(n)$ such that every affine hyperplane of $\mathbb{R}^d$ intersects
$D$ in at most $d$ points, and every hypersphere of $\mathbb{R}^n$ intersects
$D$ in at most $d+1$ points. This construction is the largest one currently
known, and strongly builds on ideas of Dong, Xu, and also of Thiele. More
generally, we prove that the role of hyperspheres can be replaced by
$Q$-quadrics, i.e. by quadratic surfaces given by an equation whose degree two
homogeneous part equals a fixed quadratic form $Q$. We formulate analogous
statements in affine spaces over (finite) fields. Essentially, every

Rational Hodge--Tate prismatic crystals of quasi-l.c.i algebras and non-abelian $p$-adic Hodge theory,2025-11-05 13:27:05+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03458v1,"Consider a bounded prism $(A,I)$ and a bounded quasi-l.c.i algebra $R$ over

flat module over $\overline{S}$, we establish an equivalence of categories
between rational Hodge-Tate crystals on $(R/A)_{\Delta}$ and topologically
nilpotent integrable connections on the Hodge--Tate cohomology ring

special algebras $R$ over $\mathcal O_{\mathbb C_p}$ (or generally, the ring of
integers of an algebraic closed and complete non-archimedean field) including
all $p$-completely smooth algebras, $p$-complete algebras with semi-stable

Hesse's Redemption: Efficient Convex Polynomial Programming,2025-11-05 13:00:01+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03440v1,"Efficient algorithms for convex optimization, such as the ellipsoid method,
require an a priori bound on the radius of a ball around the origin guaranteed
to contain an optimal solution if one exists. For linear and convex quadratic
programming, such solution bounds follow from classical characterizations of
optimal solutions by systems of linear equations. For other programs, e.g.,
semidefinite ones, examples due to Khachiyan show that optimal solutions may
require huge coefficients with an exponential number of bits, even if we allow
approximations. Correspondingly, semidefinite programming is not even known to
be in NP. The unconstrained minimization of convex polynomials of degree four
and higher has remained a fundamental open problem between these two extremes:
its optimal solutions do not admit a linear characterization and, at the same
time, Khachiyan-type examples do not apply. We resolve this problem by
developing new techniques to prove solution bounds when no linear
characterizations are available. Even for programs minimizing a convex
polynomial (of arbitrary degree) over a polyhedron, we prove that the existence
of an optimal solution implies that an approximately optimal one with
polynomial bit length also exists. These solution bounds, combined with the
ellipsoid method, yield the first polynomial-time algorithm for convex
polynomial programming, settling a question posed by Nesterov (Math. Program.,
2019). Before, no polynomial-time algorithm was known even for unconstrained
minimization of a convex polynomial of degree four.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03440v1,2511.03440v1,AG
