The drift of the considered SDEs contains a polynomial term satisfying a one-sided growth condition. Such nonlinearities in high dimensional settings occur, e.g., when stochastic reaction diffusion equations are discretized in space. We provide a brief discussion around existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions. (Almost) stability then is the basis for new concepts of Gramians that we introduce and study in this work. With the help of these Gramians, dominant subspace is identified leading to a balancing related highly accurate reduced order SDE. We provide an algebraic error criterion and an error analysis of the propose model reduction schemes. The paper is concluded by applying our method to spatially discretized reaction diffusion equations.}

Second, we extend a recently developed QB balanced truncation method to be applicable to such lifted QB systems that share the common feature of having a system matrix with zero eigenvalues. We illustrate this framework and the multi-stage lifting transformation on a tubular reactor model. In the numerical results we show that our proposed approach can obtain reduced-order models that are more accurate than proper orthogonal decomposition reduced-order models in situations where the latter are sensitive to the choice of training data.",

abstract = {Summary We introduce a data-driven model order reduction approach that represents an extension of the Loewner framework for linear and bilinear systems to the case of quadratic-bilinear (QB) systems. For certain types of nonlinear systems, one can always find an equivalent QB model without performing any approximation whatsoever. An advantage of the Loewner framework is that information about the redundancy of the given data is explicitly available, by means of the singular values of the Loewner matrices. This feature is also valid for the proposed generalization. As for the linear and bilinear cases, these matrices can be directly computed by solving Sylvester equations. We begin by defining generalized higher-order transfer functions for QB systems. These multivariate rational functions play an important role in the model order reduction process. We construct reduced-order systems for which the associated transfer functions match those corresponding to the original system at selected tuples of interpolation points. Another benefit of the proposed approach is that it is data-driven oriented, in the sense that one would only need computed or measured samples to construct a reduced-order QB system. We illustrate the practical applicability of the proposed method by means of several numerical experiments.},

Such equations are very common and occur particularly frequently in probability where the driving signal might be a vector valued Brownian motion, semi-martingale or similar process.However, our approach is deterministic, is totally independent of probability and permits much rougher paths than the Brownian paths usually discussed. The results here are strong enough to treat the main probabilistic examples and significantly widen the class of stochastic processes which can be used to drive stochastic differential equations. (For a simple example see [10], [1]).We hope our results will have an influence on infinite dimensional analysis on path spaces, loop groups, etc. as well as in more applied situations. Variable step size algorithms for the numerical integration of stochastic differential equations [8] have been constructed as a consequence of these results.},

A reduced bilinear system is constructed in such a way that it matches a desired number of moments of multivariable transfer functions corresponding to the kernels of Volterra series representation of the original system. Applications to the simulation of dynamical responses of a nonlinear circuit and a micromachined device are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the new method and compare with an approach recently proposed by Phillips.}

abstract = {This work presents a nonintrusive projection-based model reduction approach for full models based on time-dependent partial differential equations. Projection-based model reduction constructs the operators of a reduced model by projecting the equations of the full model onto a reduced space. Traditionally, this projection is intrusive, which means that the full-model operators are required either explicitly in an assembled form or implicitly through a routine that returns the action of the operators on a given vector; however, in many situations the full model is given as a black box that computes trajectories of the full-model states and outputs for given initial conditions and inputs, but does not provide the full-model operators. Our nonintrusive operator inference approach infers approximations of the reduced operators from the initial conditions, inputs, trajectories of the states, and outputs of the full model, without requiring the full-model operators. Our operator inference is applicable to full models that are linear in the state or have a low-order polynomial nonlinear term. The inferred operators are the solution of a least-squares problem and converge, with sufficient state trajectory data, in the Frobenius norm to the reduced operators that would be obtained via an intrusive projection of the full-model operators. Our numerical results demonstrate operator inference on a linear climate model and on a tubular reactor model with a polynomial nonlinear term of third order.}

   abstract = "This review discusses Operator Inference, a nonintrusive reduced modeling approach that incorporates physical governing equations by defining a structured polynomial form for the reduced model, and then learns the corresponding reduced operators from simulated training data. The polynomial model form of Operator Inference is sufficiently expressive to cover a wide range of nonlinear dynamics found in fluid mechanics and other fields of science and engineering, while still providing efficient reduced model computations. The learning steps of Operator Inference are rooted in classical projection-based model reduction; thus, some of the rich theory of model reduction can be applied to models learned with Operator Inference. This connection to projection-based model reduction theory offers a pathway toward deriving error estimates and gaining insights to improve predictions. Furthermore, through formulations of Operator Inference that preserve Hamiltonian and other structures, important physical properties such as energy conservation can be guaranteed in the predictions of the reduced model beyond the training horizon. This review illustrates key computational steps of Operator Inference through a large-scale combustion example.",
