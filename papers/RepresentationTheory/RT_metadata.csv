Uniform irreducibility of Galois action on the $\ell$-primary part of Abelian $3$-folds of Picard type,2025-11-06 18:00:14+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04609v1,"Half a century ago Manin showed that given a number field $k$ and a rational
prime $\ell$, there exists a uniform bound for the order of cyclic $\ell$-power
isogenies between two non-CM elliptic curves over $k$. We generalize this to
certain $2$-dimensional families of abelian $3$-folds with multiplication by an
imaginary quadratic field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04609v1,2511.04609v1,RT
On the structure of modular principal series representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2$ over some finite rings,2025-11-06 14:02:43+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04378v1,"The submodule structure of mod $p$ principal series representations of
$\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, for $k$ a finite field of characteristic $p$, was described
by Bardoe and Sin and has played an important role in subsequent work on the
mod $p$ local Langlands correspondence. The present paper studies the structure
of mod $p$ principal series representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathcal{O} /
\mathfrak{m}^n)$, where $\mathcal{O}$ is the ring of integers of a $p$-adic
field $F$ and $\mathfrak{m}$ its maximal ideal. In particular, the multiset of
Jordan-H\""older constituents is determined.
  In the case $n = 2$, more precise results are obtained. If $F / \mathbb{Q}_p$
is totally ramified, the submodule structure of the principal series is
determined completely. Otherwise the submodule structure is infinite. When $F$
is ramified but not totally ramified, the socle and radical filtrations are
determined and a specific family of submodules, providing a filtration of the
principal series with irreducible quotients, is studied; this family is closely
related to the image of a functor of Breuil. In the case of unramified $F$, the
structure of a particular submodule of the principal series is studied; this
provides a more precise description of the structure of a module constructed by
Breuil and Pa\u{s}k\=unas in the context of their work on diagrams giving rise
to supersingular mod $p$ representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(F)$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04378v1,2511.04378v1,RT
Character Theory for Semilinear Representations,2025-11-06 11:48:54+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04296v1,"Let $G$ be a group acting on a field $L$, and suppose that $L /K$ is a finite
Galois extension, where $K = L^G$. We show that the irreducible semilinear
representations of $G$ over $L$ can be completely described in terms of
irreducible linear representations of $H$, the kernel of $G \rightarrow
\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$. When $G$ is finite and $|G| \in L^{\times}$ this provides a
character theory for semilinear representations of $G$ over $L$, which recovers
ordinary character theory when the action of $G$ on $L$ is trivial.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04296v1,2511.04296v1,RT

perturbation \(T = U + \varepsilon E\) of the unilateral shift on
\(\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}_{\ge\ 0})\). While the polynomial algebra \(\langle T
\rangle\) is abelian, the enlarged algebra \(\mathcal{A} = \mathrm{span}\{U^a E
U^b, U^n\}\) exhibits finite--rank commutators confined to a finite
neighborhood of the boundary. We construct explicit site-localized 2-cocycles
\(\omega_j(X,Y) = \langle e_j, [X,Y] e_j \rangle\) and prove they form a basis
of \(H^2(\mathcal{A},\mathbb{C})\). Quantitative bounds and finite-dimensional
models confirm a sharp bulk-edge dichotomy. The framework provides a rigorous
Lie-algebraic model for edge phenomena in discrete quantum systems-without
violating the Jacobi identity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03927v1,2511.03927v1,RT
Random Young diagrams and Jacobi Unitary Ensemble,2025-11-05 22:00:44+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03881v1,"We consider random Young diagrams with respect to the measure induced by the
decomposition of the $p$-th exterior power of $\mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes
\mathbb{C}^{k}$ into irreducible representations of $GL_{n}\times GL_{k}$. We
demonstrate that transition probabilities for these diagrams in the limit
$n,k,p\to\infty$ with $p\sim nk$ converge to the large $N$ limiting law for the
eigenvalues of random matrices in Jacobi Unitary Ensemble. We compute the
characters of Young--Jucys--Murphy elements in

to surface counting. We formulate several conjectures on the connection between
the correlators in both random ensembles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03881v1,2511.03881v1,RT
A non-iterative straightening algorithm and orthogonality for skew Schur modules,2025-11-05 18:32:20+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03702v1,"We generalize Fulton's determinantal construction of Schur modules to the
skew setting, providing an explicit and functorial presentation using only
elementary linear algebra and determinantal identities, in parallel with the
partition case. Building on the non-iterative straightening formula of the
first author for partition shapes, we develop a non-iterative straightening
algorithm for skew Schur modules that expresses arbitrary elements in a new
D-basis with an explicit closed coefficient formula. We then show that this
D-basis is the result of applying Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to the
semistandard tableau basis, which identifies a natural inner product on the
skew Schur module and recasts straightening as an orthogonal projection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03702v1,2511.03702v1,RT
The Heisenberg algebra of a vector space and Hochschild homology,2025-11-05 17:08:15+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03649v1,"We decategorify the Heisenberg 2-category of Gyenge-Koppensteiner-Logvinenko
using Hochschild homology. We use this to generalise the Heisenberg algebra
action of Grojnowski and Nakajima to all smooth and proper noncommutative

Soibelman. For ordinary commutative varieties, we compute the resulting action
on Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology. As tools, we prove results about Heisenberg

talk at UCLA, Jan Saxl conjectured that all irreducible representations of the
symmetric group $S_n$ occur in the decomposition of the tensor square of the
irreducible representation corresponding to the staircase partition. In this
paper, we investigate two useful methods to obtain some irreducible

Pure minimal injective resolutions and perfect modules for lattices,2025-11-05 11:45:04+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03385v1,"In a recent article, Iyama and Marczinzik showed that a lattice is
distributive if and only if the incidence algebra is Auslander regular, giving
a new connection between homological algebra and lattice theory. In this
article we study when a distributive lattice has a pure minimal injective
coresolution, a notion first introduced and studied in a work of Ajitabh, Smith
and Zhang. We will see that this problem naturally leads to studying when
certain antichain modules are perfect modules. We give a classification of
perfect antichain modules under the assumption that their canonical antichain
resolution is minimal and use this to give a completion classification in
lattice theoretic terms of incidence algebras of distributive lattices with
pure minimal injective coresolution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03385v1,2511.03385v1,RT

Abstract representation theory via coherent Auslander-Reiten diagrams,2025-11-04 16:55:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02731v1,"We provide a general method to study representations of quivers over abstract
stable homotopy theories (e.g. arbitrary rings, schemes, dg algebras, or ring
spectra) in terms of Auslander-Reiten diagrams. For a finite acyclic quiver $Q$
and a stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, we prove an abstract equivalence
of the representations $\mathcal{C}^Q$ with a certain mesh $\infty$-category
$\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{Z}Q,\, \mathrm{mesh}}$ of representations of the
repetitive quiver $\mathbb{Z}Q$, that we build inductively using abstract
reflection functors. This allows to produce, from the symmetries of the
Auslander-Reiten quiver, universal autoequivalences of representations
$\mathcal{C}^Q$ in any stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, which are the
elements of the spectral Picard group of $Q$. In particular, we get abstract
versions of key functors in classical representation theory -- e.g. reflection
functors, the Auslander-Reiten translation, the Serre functor, etc. Moreover,
for representations of trees this enables us to realize the whole derived
Picard group over a field as a factor of the spectral Picard group.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02731v1,2511.02731v1,RT

Higher hereditary algebras and toric Fano stacks of Picard number one or two,2025-11-04 15:06:03+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02641v1,"We prove the existence and give a classification of all $d$-tilting bundles
(and thus geometric Helices) consisting of line bundles on $d$-dimensional
smooth toric Fano DM stacks of Picard number one or two. Here, a $d$-tilting
bundle is a tilting bundle whose endomorphism algebra has global dimension $d$
or less.
  In the case of Picard number one, tilting bundles consisting of line bundles
correspond bijectively to non-trivial upper sets in its Picard group equipped
with a certain partial order. Moreover, all of them are $d$-tilting bundles and
their endomorphisms algebras become $d$-representation infinite algebras of
type $\tilde{A}$. Conversely, all such algebras arise in this way. In this
sense, we can think of smooth toric Fano DM stacks with Picard number one as
geometric models of higher representation infinite algebras of type
$\tilde{A}$. Using this geometric model, we give a new combinatorial
description to $d$-APR tilting modules of them.
  In the case of Picard number two, $d$-tilting bundles consisting of line
bundles correspond bijectively to pairs $(I,I')$, where $I$ and $I'$ are
non-trivial upper sets in certain partially ordered sets. Here, $I$ corresponds
to a non-commutative crepant resolution (NCCR) of a certain Gorenstein toric
singularity with divisor class group of rank one and $I'$ corresponds to a cut
of the quiver of this NCCR. Moreover, the endomorphism algebras of these
$d$-tilting bundles also become $d$-representation infinite algebras.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02641v1,2511.02641v1,RT

Representations of Quantum Affine General Linear Superalgebras at Arbitrary 01-Sequences,2025-11-04 09:19:54+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02393v1,"In this paper, we investigate finite-dimensional irreducible representations
of the quantum affine general linear superalgebra

construct the RTT presentation for quantum general linear superalgebra
$\mathrm{U}_q\big(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n,\mathbf{s}}\big)$, and derive a PBW basis
induced by the action of the braid group, compatible with non-standard
parities. We determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for the
finite-dimensionality of irreducible representations of
$\mathrm{U}_q\big(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n,\mathbf{s}}\big)$ and extend the results
to the affine case via the evaluation homomorphism. Specific cases such as
$(m,n)=(1,1)$ demonstrate that all finite-dimensional representations are
