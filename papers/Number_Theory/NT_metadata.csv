Uniform irreducibility of Galois action on the $\ell$-primary part of Abelian $3$-folds of Picard type,2025-11-06 18:00:14+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04609v1,"Half a century ago Manin showed that given a number field $k$ and a rational
prime $\ell$, there exists a uniform bound for the order of cyclic $\ell$-power
isogenies between two non-CM elliptic curves over $k$. We generalize this to
certain $2$-dimensional families of abelian $3$-folds with multiplication by an
imaginary quadratic field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04609v1,2511.04609v1,NT

Class groups of imaginary biquadratic fields,2025-11-06 16:44:17+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04529v1,"We present two distinct families of imaginary biquadratic fields, each of
which contains infinitely many members, with each member having large class
groups. Construction of the first family involves elliptic curves and their
quadratic twists, whereas to find the other family, we use a combination of
elliptic and hyperelliptic curves. Two main results are used, one from Soleng
and the other from Banerjee and Hoque.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04529v1,2511.04529v1,NT
Character Theory for Semilinear Representations,2025-11-06 11:48:54+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04296v1,"Let $G$ be a group acting on a field $L$, and suppose that $L /K$ is a finite
Galois extension, where $K = L^G$. We show that the irreducible semilinear
representations of $G$ over $L$ can be completely described in terms of
irreducible linear representations of $H$, the kernel of $G \rightarrow
\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$. When $G$ is finite and $|G| \in L^{\times}$ this provides a
character theory for semilinear representations of $G$ over $L$, which recovers
ordinary character theory when the action of $G$ on $L$ is trivial.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04296v1,2511.04296v1,NT
A random polynomial with multiplicative coefficients is almost surely irreducible,2025-11-06 10:26:11+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04240v1,"Assume that the Riemann hypothesis holds for Dedekind zeta functions. Under

Zeros of special polynomials and their impact on a class of APN functions,2025-11-06 08:52:52+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04193v1,"In 2021, Calderini et al. introduced a construction for APN functions on
$\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}$ in bivariate form $$ f(x,y)=\big(xy,\, x^{2^r+1} +
x^{2^{r+m/2}} y^{2^{m/2}} + bxy^{2^r} + cy^{2^r+1}\big),\quad r < m/2,\quad
\gcd(r, m) = 1. $$ They showed that this family exists provided the existence
of a polynomial $$ P_{c,b}(X)=(cX^{2^r +1} + b
X^{2^r}+1)^{2^{m/2}+1}+X^{2^{m/2}+1}, $$ with no zeros in
$\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}$. For $m\le 6$ it was shown that we can have APN functions
belonging to this family. However, up to now, no construction of such
polynomials is known for $m\ge 8$. In this work we provide a non-existence
result of such functions whenever $r<m/8-1$, by application of techniques from
algebraic varieties over finite fields. In particular, for $r=1$ we have that
the construction of Calderini et al. cannot provide an APN function for $m\ge
8$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04193v1,2511.04193v1,NT
Kummer-faithfulness over $p$-adic fields,2025-11-06 08:43:05+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04186v1,"The notion of a Kummer-faithful field, defined by Mochizuki, is expected as
one of suitable base fields for anabelian geometry. In this paper, we study
Kummer-faithfulness for algebraic extension fields of $p$-adic fields. We show
that Kummer-faithfulness for such fields are deeply related with various
finiteness properties on torsion points of (semi-)abelian varieties. For
example, a Galois extension $K$ of a $p$-adic field is Kummer-faithful with
finite residue field if and only if, for any finite extension $L$ of $K$ and
any abelian variety over $L$,its $L$-rational torsion subgroup is finite. In
addition, we study Kummer-faithfulness for Lubin-Tate extension fields.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04186v1,2511.04186v1,NT
Prime detecting quasi-modular forms in higher level,2025-11-06 03:56:50+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04030v1,"In a previous work, the authors resolved a conjecture about the structure of
prime-detecting quasi-modular forms by studying sign changes occurring in
quasi-modular cusp forms. In this paper, we extend the considerations to
prime-detecting quasi-modular forms of higher level, in particular describing
the structure of the space of quasi-modular forms that detect primes in various
arithmetic progressions. We also provide an ``analytic'' proof of the level one
case.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04030v1,2511.04030v1,NT
An orthogonal perspective on Gauss composition,2025-11-06 02:17:47+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03987v1,"We revisit Gauss composition over a general base scheme, with a focus on
orthogonal groups. We show that the Clifford and norm functors provide a
discriminant-preserving equivalence of categories between binary quadratic
modules and pseudoregular modules over quadratic algebras. This perspective
synthesizes the constructions of Kneser and Wood, reconciling algebraic and
geometric approaches and clarifying the role of orientations and the natural
emergence of narrow class groups. As an application, we restrict to lattices
and show that binary orthogonal eigenforms correspond to Hecke characters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03987v1,2511.03987v1,NT
On Euler's Theorem,2025-11-06 02:07:14+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03979v1,"Euler's theorem asserts that $A(n)=B(n)$ where $A(n)$ is the number of
partitions of $n$ into distinct parts and $B(n)$ is the number of partitions of
$n$ into odd parts. In this paper, it is proved that for $n>0$, \begin{align*}
A(n)=B(n)=C(n+1)=\frac{1}{2}D(n+1), \end{align*} where $C(n)$ is the number of
partitions of $n$ with largest part even and parts not exceeding half of the
largest part are distinct, and $D(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$ into
non-negative parts wherein the smallest part appear exactly twice and no other
parts are repeated.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03979v1,2511.03979v1,NT
Ternary Digits of Powers of Two,2025-11-05 21:05:33+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03861v1,"The \textit{ternary digits of $2^n$} are a finite sequence of 0s, 1s, and 2s.
It is a natural question to ask whether the frequency of any string of 0s, 1s,
and 2s in this sequence approaches the same limit for all strings of the same
length, as the exponent $n$ approaches infinity (\textit{Uniform Distribution
in the limit}).
  Currently the answer to this question is unknown. Even a much weaker
conjecture by Erd\""os is still open. But we present computational results (up
to $n = 10^6$) supporting uniform distribution in the limit.
  In this context, we discuss implications of Benford's Law and a special case
of Baker's Theorem.
  Then we investigate the infinite sequence of ternary digits of $\log_3(2)$.
There are analogous questions about the distribution of strings of 0s, 1s, and
2s in that sequence. If there is uniform distribution in the limit, then
$\log_3(2)$ is called \textit{normal to base 3}.
  In the absence of definitive results, we can offer again computational
evidence from the first $10^6$ ternary digits of $\log_3(2)$, strongly
supporting the conjecture that $\log_3(2)$ is normal to base 3.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03861v1,2511.03861v1,NT
Zeros of Stern polynomials in the complex plane,2025-11-05 20:30:31+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03847v1,"The classical Stern sequence of positive integers was extended to a
polynomial sequence $S_n(\lambda)$ by Klav\v{z}ar et. al. by defining
$S_0(\lambda) = 0$, $S_1(\lambda) = 1$, and $$S_{2n}(\lambda) = \lambda
S_n(\lambda),\quad S_{2n+1}(\lambda) = S_n(\lambda) + S_{n+1}(\lambda).$$
Dilcher et. al. conjectured that all roots of $S_n(\lambda)$ lie in the
half-plane $\{\operatorname{Re} w < 1\}$. We make partial progress on this
conjecture by proving that $\{|w-2| \leq 1\}\subseteq\mathbb C$ does not
contain any roots of $S_n(\lambda)$. Our proof uses the Parabola Theorem for
convergence of complex continued fractions. As a corollary, we establish a
conjecture of Ulas and Ulas by showing that $S_p(\lambda)$ is irreducible in
$\mathbb Z[\lambda]$ whenever $p$ is a positive prime.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03847v1,2511.03847v1,NT
Rational Hodge--Tate prismatic crystals of quasi-l.c.i algebras and non-abelian $p$-adic Hodge theory,2025-11-05 13:27:05+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03458v1,"Consider a bounded prism $(A,I)$ and a bounded quasi-l.c.i algebra $R$ over
$\overline{A}$. In this paper, for any prism $S/A$ with a surjection $S\to R$
such that $\widehat{\mathbb L}_{\overline{S}/\overline{A}}$ is a $p$-completely
flat module over $\overline{S}$, we establish an equivalence of categories
between rational Hodge-Tate crystals on $(R/A)_{\Delta}$ and topologically
nilpotent integrable connections on the Hodge--Tate cohomology ring
$\overline{\Delta}_{R/S}$. As an application, for a non-zero divisor $a\in
\overline{A}$, we introduce the concept of $a$-smallness for a rational
Hodge-Tate prismatic crystal on $(R/A)_{\Delta}$. Finally, we focus on some
special algebras $R$ over $\mathcal O_{\mathbb C_p}$ (or generally, the ring of
integers of an algebraic closed and complete non-archimedean field) including
all $p$-completely smooth algebras, $p$-complete algebras with semi-stable
reductions and geometric valuation rings. By using our equivalence, we analyze
the restriction functor from the category of $a$-small rational Hodge-Tate
prismatic crystals to the category of $v$-vector bundles. This yields some new
results in $p$-adic non-abelian Hodge Theory.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03458v1,2511.03458v1,NT
Arithmetic invariants of torus links,2025-11-05 13:07:13+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03446v1,"The classical analogy between knots and primes motivates the study of
Alexander polynomials through an arithmetic perspective. In this article we
study the two-parameter family of torus knots and links $T_{p,q}$ and analyze
the asymptotic behaviour of the zeros of their Alexander polynomials
$\Delta_{p,q}(t)$, defined with respect to the total linking number covering.
We prove that as $p,q\to\infty$ these zeros become equidistributed on the unit
circle and derive an explicit formula for the limiting frequency with which
primitive $r$-th roots of unity appear. To capture finer statistical
information, we introduce the moment sequence of the zero distribution and
compute its generating function in closed form. We further examine the Iwasawa
theory of the corresponding branched covers, determining the Iwasawa
invariants. The logarithmic Mahler measure of $\Delta_{p,q}(t)$ vanishes
identically and the associated homological growth in towers of abelian covers
of $S^3$ branched along $T_{p,q}$ is subexponential.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03446v1,2511.03446v1,NT
Coincidence among sum formulas for zeta-like multiple values,2025-11-05 12:49:06+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03431v1,"We study two families of zeta-like multiple series -- the multiple
$\rho$-values and the multiple $\eta$-values -- defined by nested sums with
shifted denominators. An explicit factorial formula for $\rho$ reveals its
intrinsic combinatorial structure and leads to closed expressions for fixed
weight and depth. A remarkable identity emerges from a weighted-sum
transformation, exhibiting a perfect discrete balance. The main theorem proves
that the total sums of $\rho$- and $\eta$-values coincide for equal weight but
complementary depths. This correspondence provides an analytic basis for
integral representations of $\eta$-values and for deriving weighted sum
relations. Together, these results show that the $\rho$- and $\eta$-families
form two complementary realizations of a unified analytic-combinatorial
structure, bridging factorial and harmonic formulations in zeta-like multiple
sums.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03431v1,2511.03431v1,NT

random multiplicative function, the partial sums over $y$-smooth numbers enjoy
better than squareroot cancellation, in the sense that $$ \mathbb E

bounds are quantitative and give a large saving when $y$ isn't too close to
$x$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03430v1,2511.03430v1,NT
Tropicalization and cluster asymptotic phenomenon of generalized Markov equations,2025-11-05 12:45:08+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03428v1,"The generalized Markov equations are deeply connected with the generalized
cluster algebras of Markov type. We construct a deformed Fock-Goncharov
tropicalization for the generalized Markov equations and prove that their
tropicalized tree structure is essentially the same as that of the classical
Euclid tree. We then define the generalized Euclid tree and prove that it
converges to the classical Euclid tree up to a scalar multiple. Moreover, by
means of cluster mutations, we exhibit an asymptotic phenomenon, up to some
limit q, between the logarithmic generalized Markov tree and the classical
Euclid tree. A rationality conjecture of q is then put forward. We also propose
a generalized Markov uniqueness conjecture for the generalized Markov
equations, which illustrates an application of the asymptotic phenomenon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03428v1,2511.03428v1,NT

A higher rank shifted convolution problem with applications to L-functions,2025-11-05 08:44:24+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03294v1,"While several instances of shifted convolution problems for GL(3) x GL(2)

$\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic relations among adjoint multiple zeta values, referred

the affine scheme $\mathrm{AdDMR}_0$ determined by the adjoint double shuffle
relations and posed a question whether $\mathrm{AdDMR}_0$ is isomorphic to
Racinet's double shuffle group $\mathrm{DMR}_0$. In this paper, we refine
