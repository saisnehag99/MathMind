By staying within a world of topological pictures a little longer than in other articles on the subject, the required extension becomes essentially tautological. And then a simple application of an appropriate functor (a “TQFT”) to our pictures takes them to the familiar realm of complexes of (graded) vector spaces and ordinary homological invariants.},

The article also develops the theory of odd symmetric functions initiated a decade ago by Ellis, Khovanov and Lauda. A key role in our approach is played by a 2-category consisting of odd Grassmannian bimodules over superalgebras which are odd analogs of equivariant cohomology algebras of Grassmannians. This is the odd analog of the category of Grassmannian bimodules which was at the heart of Lauda's independent approach to categorification of sl(2). We also construct an action of the odd Kac-Moody 2-category of sl(2) on the 2-category of odd Grassmannian bimodules, and use this to give a new proof of its non-degeneracy.},

  abstract = {We propose a framework for unifying the sl(N) Khovanov– Rozansky homology (for all N) with the knot Floer homology. We argue that this unification should be accomplished by a triply graded homology theory that categorifies the HOMFLY polynomial. Moreover, this theory should have an additional formal structure of a family of differentials. Roughly speaking, the triply graded theory by itself captures the large-N behavior of the sl(N) homology, and differentials capture nonstable behavior for small N, including knot Floer homology. The differentials themselves should come from another variant of sl(N) homology, namely the deformations of it studied by Gornik, building on work of Lee. While we do not give a mathematical definition of the triply graded theory, the rich formal structure we propose is powerful enough to make many nontrivial predictions about the existing knot homologies that can then be checked directly. We include many examples in which we can exhibit a likely candidate for the triply graded theory, and these demonstrate the internal consistency of our axioms. We conclude with a detailed study of torus knots, developing a picture that gives new predictions even for the original sl(2) Khovanov homology.}

In the rank one case, the uncolored Uq(osp(1|2)) link invariant is equal to the Ut−1q(sl2) link invariant where t2 = −1. We define a skein relation similar to the Kauffman bracket, and use that to recover an oriented link invariant which coincides with Clark’s uncolored osp(1|2)-link invariant. This definition also comes from the representation theory of Uq,π(sl2), but using different methods from Clark. We show that our invariant is easily categorified by a slightly modified version of Khovanov homology equipped with an extra 4-grading. We also construct a similarly modified version of Putyra’s covering Khovanov homology [28]. This suggests that the similarity between the two invariants holds at the categorified level as well.},

This framework then extends to give our annular sln link homology theory, which we call sutured annular Khovanov-Rozansky homology.

In the n = 2 case, this produces a categorification of the Jones polynomial that we show is distinct from Khovanov homology, and gives a finite-dimensional categorification of the colored Jones polynomial.

In this paper, we focus on the question of finding bases. As an application, we give the first proof of a basis theorem for graded \$\textbackslash mathfrak\{gl\}\_2\$-foams, a certain diagrammatic algebra appearing in categorification and quantum topology. Our approach is algorithmic, combining linear rewriting, higher rewriting and rewriting modulo another set of rules -- for diagrammatic algebras, the modulo rules typically capture a categorical property, such as pivotality. In the process, we give novel approaches to the foundations of these theories, including to the notion of confluence. Other important tools include termination rules that depend on contexts, rewriting modulo invertible scalars, and a practical guide to classifying branchings modulo. This article is written to be accessible to experts on diagrammatic algebras with no prior knowledge on rewriting theory, and vice-versa.},

In another direction, Naisse and Putyra gave a categorification of the Temperley-Lieb algebra compatible with odd Khovanov homology, introducing new machinery called grading categories. We provide a generalization of Naisse and Putyra's work in the spirit of Bar-Natan's canopolies or Jones's planar algebras, replacing grading categories with grading multicategories. We use our setup to prove the existence and uniqueness of categorified Jones-Wenzl projectors in odd Khovanov homology.
