A priori estimates and $η-$compactness for anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau minimizers with tangential anchoring,2025-11-06 18:56:59+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04672v1,"We consider minimizers $u_\varepsilon$ of the Ginzburg-Landau energy with
quadratic divergence or curl penalization on a simply-connected two-dimensional
domain $\Omega$. On the boundary, strong tangential anchoring is imposed. We
prove a priori estimates for $u_\varepsilon$ in $L^\infty$ uniform in
$\varepsilon$ and that the Lipschitz constant of $u_\varepsilon$ blows up like
$\varepsilon^{-1}$. We then deduce compactness for a subsequence that converges
to an $\mathbb{S}^1-$valued map with either one interior point defect or two
boundary half-defects. We conclude our study with a proof that no boundary
vortices can occur in the divergence penalized case.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04672v1,2511.04672v1,CA
Weighted wave envelope estimates for the parabola,2025-11-06 16:23:49+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04503v1,"In this paper, we extend Fefferman's classical square function estimate for
the parabola to a weighted setting. Our weighted square function estimate is
derived from a weighted wave envelope estimate for the parabola. The bounds are
formulated in terms of families of multiscale tubes together with weight
parameters that quantify the distribution of the weight. As an application, we
obtain some weighted L^p-estimates for a class of Fourier multiplier operators
and for solutions to free Schrodinger equation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04503v1,2511.04503v1,CA

Signature-Based Universal Bilinear Approximations for Nonlinear Systems and Model Order Reduction,2025-11-06 12:10:22+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04303v1,"This paper deals with non-Lipschitz nonlinear systems. Such systems can be
approximated by a linear map of so-called signatures, which play a crucial role
in the theory of rough paths and can be interpreted as collections of iterated
integrals involving the control process. As a consequence, we identify a
universal bilinear system, solved by the signature, that can approximate the
state or output of the original nonlinear dynamics arbitrarily well. In
contrast to other (bi)linearization techniques, the signature approach remains
feasible in large-scale settings, as the dimension of the associated bilinear
system grows only with the number of inputs. However, the signature model is
typically of high order, requiring an optimization process based on model order
reduction (MOR). We derive an MOR method for unstable bilinear systems with
non-zero initial states and apply it to the signature, yielding a potentially
low-dimensional bilinear model. An advantage of our method is that the original
nonlinear system need not be known explicitly, since only data are required to
learn the linear map of the signature. The subsequent MOR procedure is
model-oriented and specifically designed for the signature process.
Consequently, this work has two main applications: (1) efficient modeling/data
fitting using small-scale bilinear systems, and (2) MOR for nonlinear systems.
We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in the second application
through numerical experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04303v1,2511.04303v1,CA
Two-Scale Frostman Measures,2025-11-06 12:09:59+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04302v1,"We establish a unified Frostman-type framework connecting the classical

a family of measures $\{\mu_\delta\}$ supported on $E$ satisfying two
simultaneous decay conditions, corresponding to the Hausdorff and intermediate

two-scale characterization of the dimension of $E$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04302v1,2511.04302v1,CA
Recurrence coefficients for the time-evolved Jacobi weight and discrete Painlevé equations on the $D_{5}$ Sakai surface,2025-11-06 08:27:42+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04176v1,"In this paper, we focus on the relationship between the

Introduction to the theory of mixing for incompressible flows,2025-11-05 11:01:53+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03360v1,"In these lecture notes, we provide a pedagogical introduction to the theory
of mixing for incompressible flows from a PDE perspective. We discuss both the
Lagrangian (ODE) and Eulerian (PDE, continuity equation) viewpoints, and
introduce suitable notions of mixing scales that quantify the degree to which a
scalar field transported by a velocity field becomes mixed. We then address the
problem of establishing universal lower bounds on the time evolution of the
mixing scale. This is first done in the smooth setting, using energy estimates
and flow-based arguments, and later in the Sobolev setting, relying on
quantitative estimates for regular Lagrangian flows. Finally, we present recent
results concerning the sharpness of these lower bounds, their implications for
the geometry and regularity of regular Lagrangian flows, and connections with
more recent developments in the literature.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03360v1,2511.03360v1,CA

A Christ-Fefferman type approach to the one sided maximal operator,2025-11-04 17:10:43+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02741v2,"In this paper, an approach to the one sided maximal function in the spirit of

Schatten properties of commutators of fractional integrals on spaces of homogeneous type,2025-11-04 16:09:28+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02686v1,"Extending classical results of Janson and Peetre (1988) on the Schatten class
$S^p$ membership of commutators of Riesz potentials on the Euclidean space, we
obtain analogous results for commutators $[b,T]$, where
$T\in\{T_\varepsilon,\widetilde T_\alpha\}$ belongs to either one of two
natural classes of fractional integral operators on a space of homogeneous
type. Our approach is based on recent related work of Hyt\""{o}nen and Korte on
singular (instead of fractional) integrals; working directly with the kernels,
it differs from the Fourier analytic considerations of Janson and Peetre,
covering new operators even when specialised to $\mathbb R^d$.
  The cleanest case of our characterization in spaces of lower dimension $d> 2$
and satisfying a $(1,2)$-Poincar\'e inequality is as follows. For a parameter
$\varepsilon \in (0,\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{d})$ describing the order of the
fractional integral $T_\varepsilon $, we have a dichotomy: If
$\frac{d}{1+d\varepsilon }<p<\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$, then
$[b,T_{\varepsilon}]\in S^p$ if and only if $b$ belongs to a suitable Besov (or
fractional Sobolev) space. If $0<p\leq \frac{d}{1+d\varepsilon }$, then
$[b,T_{\varepsilon}]\in S^p$ if and only if $b$ is constant. This is analogous
to the result for singular integrals, where a similar cut-off happens at $p=d$,
formally corresponding to fractional order $\varepsilon =0$. We also obtain
results for other parameter values, including dimensions $0<d\leq 2$.
  As an application, these results are used to show Schatten properties of
commutators of fractional Bessel operators, complementing recent related
results of Fan, Lacey, Li, and Xiong (2025) on commutators of singular
integrals in the Bessel setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02686v1,2511.02686v1,CA

Signal recovery using Gabor frames,2025-11-04 15:38:13+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02661v1,"We present a novel probabilistic framework for the recovery of discrete
signals with missing data, extending classical Fourier-based methods. While
prior results, such as those of Donoho and Stark; see also Logan's method,
guarantee exact recovery under strict deterministic sparsity constraints, they
do not account for stochastic patterns of data loss. Our approach combines a
row-wise Gabor transform with a probabilistic model for missing frequencies,
establishing near-certain recovery when losses occur randomly.
  The key innovation is a maximal row-support criterion that allows unique
reconstruction with high probability, even when the overall signal support
significantly exceeds classical bounds. Specifically, we show that if missing
frequencies are independently distributed according to a binomial law, the
probability of exact recovery converges to $1$ as the signal size grows. This
provides, to our knowledge, the first rigorous probabilistic recovery guarantee
exploiting row-wise signal structure.
  Our framework offers new insights into the interplay between sparsity,
transform structure, and stochastic loss, with immediate implications for
communications, imaging, and data compression. It also opens avenues for future
research, including extensions to higher-dimensional signals, adaptive
transforms, and more general probabilistic loss models, potentially enabling
even more robust recovery guarantees.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02661v1,2511.02661v1,CA

open regions in the parameter space of the Lorenz system where one can
canonically reduce the dynamics of the Lorenz attractor into those of a
symmetric Lorenz map $F_\beta$ with a constant slope $\beta\in(1,2]$. As we
will show, not only the map $F_\beta$ encodes many of the essential features of
