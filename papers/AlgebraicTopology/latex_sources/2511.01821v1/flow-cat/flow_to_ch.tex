\subsection{Recovering contact homology}\label{subsec:contact homology}
We sketch that our flow category recovers contact homology, a classical invariant of closed contact manifolds, following \cite{Par19}. Let $(Y^{2n-1},\xi)$ be a closed contact manifold equipped with a non-degenerate contact form $\lambda$ as before. Fix a choice of $\lambda$-adapted almost complex structure $J$ and action bound $L$ as well as the perturbation data required for the construction of the stably complex flow category $\scM^{Y,\lambda}_{\leq L}$. We will outline how this data yields a $\bZ/2$-graded chain complex $(CC_*(Y,\xi)_\lambda^{\leq L},\del)$, where
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:chains}
    CC^{\leq L}_*(Y,\xi)_\lambda \coloneqq \bigoplus\limits_{k\geq 0}\text{Sym}^k_\bQ\lbr{\bigoplus\limits_{\gamma\in (\cP_{\leq L})_{\text{good}}}\fo_\gamma\otimes\bQ} ,
\end{equation}
and the differential on the space generated by $\fo_{\Gamma^+} = \fo_{\gamma_1}\dots \fo_{\gamma_k}$ is induced by the map 
 \begin{equation}
     \partial_{\Gamma} \;\coloneqq\;\s{\Gamma^-}{\;\vfc{\scM^{Y,\lambda}_{\leq L}(\Gamma^-,\Gamma)_{(0)}}}
 \end{equation}
where $\scM^{Y,\lambda}_{\leq L}(\Gamma^-,\Gamma^+)_{(0)}$ is the part of the morphism space of virtual dimension $0$ and $\vfc{\cdot}$ is any choice of virtual count as in \cite[\S4]{Par19} or \cite[\S9]{BH23}. The fact that these virtual counts define well-defined maps between orientation lines follows from the existence of stable complex structures, Theorem~\ref{thm:stable-complex-structure} on the flow category $\scM^{Y,\lambda}_{\le L}$.\par 
For the sketch, recall that the orientation line $\fo_\gamma$ defined in \textsection\ref{subsec:orientation} and has parity 
$$|\fo_{\gamma}| = |\gamma| = \text{sign}(\det(\ide-A_\gamma)),$$ 
where $A_\gamma$ is the asymptotic operator associated to $\gamma$. We set $|\Gamma| = \sum_{i=1}^k|\gamma_i|$ for $\Gamma = (\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_k)$ and use this to grade the chain complex~\eqref{eq:chains}. The key properties of the maps $\del_\Gamma$ are
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\del_\Gamma$ has odd degree for each $\Gamma$
    \item the maps satisfy the Leibniz rule 
$$\partial_{(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)} = \partial_{(\gamma_1)}\otimes\ide + (-1)^{|\gamma_1|}\ide\otimes\partial_{(\gamma_2)}.$$
\end{enumerate}  
Both follow from studying the relevant moduli spaces of buildings. Then, the maps $\del_\Gamma$ descend to a map $\del$ on $CC_*(Y,\xi)_\lambda^{\leq L}$ and it remains to show that $\del^2 = 0$. Once this is proven, the \emph{contact homology of action at most $L$} of $(Y,\lambda)$ will be
    $$HC^{\le L}_*(Y,\xi)_\lambda := H_*(CC^{\leq L}_*(Y,\xi)_\lambda,\del).$$
