We provide a general method to study representations of quivers over abstract stable homotopy theories (e.g. arbitrary rings, schemes, dg algebras, or ring spectra) in terms of Auslander-Reiten diagrams. 

For a finite acyclic quiver $Q$ and a stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, we prove an abstract equivalence of the representations $\mathcal{C}^Q$ with a certain \emph{mesh $\infty$-category} $\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{Z}Q,\, \mathrm{mesh}}$ of representations of the repetitive quiver $\mathbb{Z}Q$, that we build inductively using abstract reflection functors. This allows to produce, from the symmetries of the Auslander-Reiten quiver, \emph{universal autoequivalences} of representations $\mathcal{C}^Q$ in any stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, which are the elements of the \emph{spectral Picard group} of $Q$. In particular, we get abstract versions of key functors in classical representation theory ---e.g. reflection functors, the Auslander-Reiten translation, the Serre functor, etc. Moreover, for representations of trees this enables us to realize the whole derived Picard group over a field as a factor of the spectral Picard group.
