The Bailey-Zeta Transform and its Classical Limit to the Riemann Zeta Function,2025-11-04 21:20:11+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03009v1,"We develop a unified analytic and algebraic framework connecting the theory
of Bailey pairs with $q$-deformations of the Riemann zeta function. First, an
algebraic theorem (Bailey-Zeta transform) extends the classical Bailey lemma to
sequences weighted by a zeta-type factor $q^{sr}$. Next, we establish
rigorously that the generating function arising from the pair $\alpha_r\equiv1$
converges, under the scaling $(1-q)^s$, to $\zeta(s)$ as $q\to1^-$. A
$q$-analogue of the Euler--Mascheroni constant naturally emerges from this
framework, and its limit is shown to recover $\gamma$. The approach highlights
a deep correspondence between combinatorial $q$-series identities and analytic
number theory.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03009v1,2511.03009v1,GM
Some smooth divergences for $\ell_{1}-$approximations,2025-10-31 19:32:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00219v1,"For some smooth special case of generalized $\varphi-$divergences as well as

The Lah Numbers with Higher Level and the Lah Numbers of Order s,2025-10-30 08:46:08+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26842v1,"In this paper we introduce and study two generalizations of Lah numbers,
analogous to the Stirling numbers with higher level - a combinatorial one (Lah
numbers with higher level) and an algebraic one (Lah numbers of order $s$). We
define the Lah numbers with higher level following a combinatorial approach and
the Lah numbers of order $s$ following an algebraic approach. We prove a direct
connection between the Lah numbers with higher level and the $(l,r)$-Lah
numbers. Some properties of the Lah numbers of order $s$ and Lah polynomials of
order $s$ are given. Finally, we prove connections between these two
generalizations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26842v1,2510.26842v1,GM
Parametric proofs of the Pythagorean theorem via ziggurats and pyramids,2025-10-30 01:41:33+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00089v1,"We propose two new proofs of the Pythagorean theorem via area rearrangement
arguments starting from very simple geometric configurations. The constructions
depend on an angular parameter, each choice of which yields a proof. For
specific values of the parameter, we recover some classical and more recent
proofs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00089v1,2511.00089v1,GM
Using Simple Linear Models with Truncation to Determine the Gregorian Day of the Week,2025-10-29 19:56:18+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00082v2,"The Gregorian calendar -- first established for daily use on Friday, October
15th, 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII in Catholic countries -- is presently the most
pervasive calendar in the world. As such, algorithms for performing various
calendrical computations in accurate, performant, and easily implementable ways
are extremely useful in fields like software engineering. In this paper, we
present a novel algorithm for determining the day of the week for any date in
the Gregorian calendar. Of note, our algorithm does not rely on remembering
tables of values. Instead, we encode tables needed for computation using simple
linear regression with truncation to adjust for any errors present in our
linear models in such a way that no tables have to be recalled. In addition,
our algorithm does not require a relabeling of days, weeks, months, or years to
values other than their intuitive representations. The algorithm works by
taking a date in the Gregorian calendar, calculating the number of days
(accounting for leap years using simple linear regression with truncation) that
have elapsed since the epoch of the Gregorian calendar in 1582 from the
specified date and adding this number modulo 7 to the epoch's day of the week
thus, obtaining the day of the week for the requested date in numeric form.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00082v2,2511.00082v2,GM
On a power series distribution with mean parameterization,2025-10-29 09:30:25+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00069v1,"The article examines the distribution of the power series of the function $
w(y) = \left( 1 + \sqrt{1 - y} \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}. $ The distribution of
the considered function into a power series is obtained $ \left(1 + \sqrt{1 -
y}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{(4m)! \, 16^{-m}}{(2m)! \,
(2m+1)! \, \sqrt{2}} \, y^m. $ The dispersion function is found $ \nu(x) = x
(2x + 1)(4x + 1), \; x > 0. $ A distribution with mean parameterization is
constructed $ \Pr(\xi = k) = \binom{4k + 1}{2k} \, 2^{-k} \, x^k \, (2k + 1)^{k

Transient waves in linear dispersive media with dissipation: an approach based on the steepest descent path,2025-10-28 07:48:42+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00045v1,"In the study of linear dispersive media it is of primary interest to gain
knowledge of the impulse response of the material. The standard approach to
compute the response involves a Laplace transform inversion, i.e., the solution
of a Bromwich integral, which can be a notoriously troublesome problem. In this
paper we propose a novel approach to the calculation of the impulse response,
based on the well assessed method of the steepest descent path, which results
in the replacement of the Bromwich integral with a real line integral along the
steepest descent path. In this exploratory investigation, the method is
explained and applied to the case study of the Klein- Gordon equation with
dissipation, for which analytical solutions of the Bromwich integral are
available, as to compare the numerical solutions obtained by the newly proposed
method to exact ones. Since the newly proposed method, at its core, consists in
replacing a Laplace transform inverse with a potentially much less demanding
real line integral, the method presented here could be of general interest in
the study of linear dispersive waves in presence of dissipation, as well as in
other fields in which Laplace transform inversion come into play.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00045v1,2511.00045v1,GM
Exact Solutions for Classes of Nonlinear Differential Equations on Fractal Supports,2025-10-27 17:26:39+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00036v1,"In this paper, the exact solutions of certain non-linear differential
equations defined on a fractal subset of the real line are presented.

A Sieve on Rational Imbalances and the First Appearance of Denominators,2025-10-26 11:41:11+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22635v1,"We construct a sieve that enumerates rational ``imbalances'' of the form
$(p-q)/(p+q)$ for integers $p\ge2$ and $1\le q<p$, ordered lexicographically by
$(p,q)$. Each imbalance is reduced to lowest terms, and we record the sequence
of distinct denominators as they first appear.
  We show that every positive integer occurs exactly once as such a
denominator, and that its first appearance coincides with the unit fraction
$1/d$.
  We then prove that the sieve, when viewed as a map from pairs $(p,q)$ to
reduced fractions, enumerates all rational numbers in $(-1,1)$ without
repetition, extend it symmetrically to all of $\mathbb{Q}$, and discuss its
connections to hyperbolic geometry and rational enumeration theory.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22635v1,2510.22635v1,GM
Sine Laws with an Anti-Automorphism: A Left-Translation Approach,2025-10-23 09:48:20+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00019v2,"Stetk\ae r's matrix method is a useful tool for analyzing functional
equations on semigroups involving a homomorphism $\sigma$. However, this method
fails when $\sigma$ is an anti-automorphism because the underlying
right-regular representation reverses composition order. To resolve this, we
introduce a new approach based on a key conjugation identity. Let $J$ denote
the operator of composition with $\sigma$; then the identity $J R(\sigma(y)) J
= L(y)$ provides the foundation for our method. This identity restores a
well-behaved representation via left translations, making the matrix method
applicable again. This left-translation approach is illustrated with several
concrete examples from matrix groups and symmetric groups. Using this approach,
we extend Stetk\ae r's main structural theorem for the generalized sine law to
the anti-automorphic setting. For linearly independent solutions, we show that
the equation implies a simpler addition law and that the solutions obey the
same transformation rules ($f\circ\sigma=\beta f$, etc.) as in the homomorphic
case.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00019v2,2511.00019v2,GM
"Energy Decay in Measure Time: HUM Observability, Product-Exponential Envelopes, and GCC Calibration",2025-10-23 09:10:34+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20371v1,"We prove that for impulsive exposure patterns there is no uniform exponential
energy law in wall-clock time t, which explains why past t-based unifications
of continuous damping with impulses fail. We therefore replace t by a
measure-valued clock, sigma, that aggregates absolutely continuous exposure and
atomic doses within a single Lyapunov ledger. On this ledger we prove an
observability-dissipation principle in the sense of the Hilbert Uniqueness
Method (HUM): there exists a structural constant c_sigma > 0 such that the
energy decays at least at a product-exponential rate with respect to sigma.
When sigma = t, the statement reduces to classical exponential stabilization
with the same constant. For the damped wave under the Geometric Control
Condition (GCC), the constant is calibrated by the usual observability and
geometric factors. The framework yields a monotonicity principle (""more
sigma-mass implies faster decay"") and unifies intermittent regimes where
quiescent intervals are punctuated by impulses. As robustness, secondary to the
main contribution, the same decay law persists under structure-compatible
discretizations and along compact variational limits; a stochastic extension
supplies expectation and pathwise envelopes via the compensator. The
contribution is a qualitative dynamics backbone: observability implies
sigma-exponential decay with sharp constants.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20371v1,2510.20371v1,GM
On Narayana numbers which are products of four $b$-repdigits with a consequence,2025-10-21 06:16:02+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18916v1,"In this paper, we focus on Narayana numbers which can be written as a

configurations give rise to multiple disjoint closed loops. We propose a
modular-arithmetic-based algorithm to systematically generate such patterns,

to demonstrate the resulting multi-loop structures. These multi-loop Kolam
designs can inspire architectural motifs and ornamental patterns in floor

Schur-Convex Curvature on Dihedral Exponential Families and the Golden-Ratio Stationary Point,2025-10-20 14:00:08+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20845v1,"We investigate the Schur-complement curvature of D_N-equivariant folded
exponential families on the simplex. Our main structural results are: (i) the
curvature kappa_Schur(theta) is convex in the log-parameter theta = ln(q); (ii)
it admits a unique stationary point at the golden ratio value q* = phi^-2 (in
particular for N = 12); and (iii) it obeys a quadratic folded law kappa_Schur =
A(N, m_rho^2) I_1^2 + B(N, m_rho^2) (I_2 - I_1^2), with coefficients A, B
determined explicitly by the projector metric of radius m_rho^2. Taken
together, these results show that convexity and symmetry alone enforce both the
location and the functional form of the ""golden lock-in.""
  Beyond their intrinsic interest, these findings identify D_12 as the minimal
dihedral lattice where parity (mod 2) and three-cycle (mod 3) constraints
coexist, producing a structurally stable equilibrium at the golden ratio. This
places the golden ratio not as an accident of parameterization but as a
necessary consequence of convex geometry under dihedral symmetry. Possible
applications include harmonic analysis on group orbits, invariant convex
optimization, and the structure of tilings or quasicrystal-like systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20845v1,2510.20845v1,GM
Generalized quasiorders: constructions and characterizations,2025-10-20 13:37:18+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00014v1,"Quasiorders $\varrho\subseteq A^{2}$ have the property that an operation
$f:A^{n}\to A$ preserves $\varrho$ if and only if each (unary) translation
obtained from $f$ is an endomorphism of $\rho$. Generalized quasiorders
$\rho\subseteq A^{m} $ are generalizations of (binary) quasiorders sharing the
same property. We show how new generalized quasiorders can be obtained from
given ones using well-known algebraic constructions. Special generalized
quasiorders, as generalized equivalences and (weak) generalized partial orders,
are introduced, which extend the corresponding notions for binary relations. It
turns out that generalized equivalences can be characterized by usual
equivalence relations. Extending some known results of binary quasiorders, it
is shown that generalized quasiorders can be ``decomposed'' uniquely into a
(weak) generalized partial order and a generalized equivalence. Furthermore,
generalized quasiorders of maximal clones determined by equivalence or partial
order relations are investigated. If $F=Pol\,\varrho$ is a maximal clone and
$\varrho$ an equivalence relation or a lattice order, then every(!) relation in
$Inv\, F$ is a generalized quasiorder. Moreover, lattice orders are
characterized by this property among all partial orders. Finally we prove that
each term operation of a rectangular algebra gives rise to a generalized
partial order. Some problems requiring further research are also highlighted.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00014v1,2511.00014v1,GM
Fractional harmonic transform on point cloud manifolds,2025-10-20 09:33:16+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20842v1,"Three-dimensional point clouds can be viewed as discrete samples of smooth
manifolds, allowing spectral analysis using the Laplace-Beltrami operator
(LBO). However, the traditional point cloud manifold harmonic transform (PMHT)
is limited by its fixed basis functions and single spectral representation,
which restricts its ability to capture complex geometric features. This paper
proposes a point cloud manifold fractional harmonic transform (PMFHT), which
generalizes PMHT by introducing fractional-order parameters and constructs a
continuously adjustable intermediate fractional-order spectral domain between
the spatial domain and the frequency domain. This fractional-order framework
supports more flexible transformation and filtering operations. Experiments
show that choosing different transformation orders can enrich the spectral
representation of point clouds and achieve excellent results in tasks such as
filtering and feature enhancement. Therefore, PMFHT not only expands the
theoretical framework of point cloud spectral analysis, but also provides a
powerful new tool for manifold geometry processing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20842v1,2510.20842v1,GM

An ε-free rank-6 decoupling estimate for the paraboloid surface,2025-10-14 06:34:05+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20834v1,"For the paraboloid decomposition $F=\sum_{\Theta} F_{\Theta}$ with

$\lambda\to\infty$, where $D=\lambda^{1/12}$. Key components: (i) broad
geometry of rank 3: bilipschitz behavior of normals gives
$\max{i<j<k}|n_i\wedge n_j\wedge n_k|\gtrsim \lambda^{-5/4}$, which via a
trilinear Kakeya-BCT insertion contributes $+5/36$ in $\lambda$; (ii) kernel
estimate: twelve integrations (6 in $t$, 6 in $x^{\prime}$) and measure
analysis (Schur and $TT^{}$) yield $|K|{L^2\to L^2}\lesssim \lambda^{-9/2}

(v) tube packing: explanatory only; (vi) narrow cascade: a double $7/8$
rescaling exits the narrow regime and contributes $-5/64$ in $\lambda$ (zero in
$D$). Summing exponents: $\Sigma_{\lambda}=5/36-9/2-5/64=-2557/576\approx
