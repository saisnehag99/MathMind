We thank Amir Ali Ahmadi for bringing the problem of efficient minimization of convex polynomials to our attention. We thank Rares-Darius Buhai, Jarosław Błasiok,  Hongjie Chen, Jingqiu~Ding and Yiding Hua for valuable discussions at an early stage of the project.
We thank Abraar~Chaudhry for a discussion on quadratic lower bounds for convex polynomials.
We thank Kevin~Shu for a discussion on polynomials with vanishing Hessian determinant, and in particular for pointing us to the Schwartz-Zippel lemma.
