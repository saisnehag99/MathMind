Dynamics of Word Maps on Groups and Polynomial Maps on Algebras,2025-11-06 14:01:57+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04377v1,"We introduce the notions of Fatou and Julia sets in the context of word maps
on complex Lie groups and polynomial maps on finite-dimensional associative
$\mathbb C$-algebras. For the group-theoretic question, we investigate the
dynamics of the power map $x \mapsto x^{M}$ on the Lie group
$\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb C)$, where $M \geq 2$ is an integer. For the
algebra-related question, we study polynomial self-maps of
$\mathrm{M}_n(\mathbb C)$ induced by monic one-variable polynomials. In both
cases, we pin down the explicit description of the Fatou and Julia sets. We
also show that there does not exist any wandering Fatou component of the pair
$(p,\mathrm{M}_n(\mathbb C))$ where $p\in\mathbb C[z]$ is a monic polynomial of
degree $\geq 2$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04377v1,2511.04377v1,RA
Amitsur--Small Extensions and a Skew Amitsur--Small Theorem,2025-11-06 11:42:38+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04295v1,"We introduce the notion of Amitsur--Small extensions to generalize a key
lemma underlying the Amitsur--Small Theorem to the skew setting. Building on

"$(n,d)$-injective and $(n,d)$-flat modules under a special semidualizing bimodule",2025-11-06 03:57:29+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04031v1,"Let $S$ and $R$ be rings, $n, d\geq 0$ be two integers or $n=\infty$. In this
paper, first we introduce special (faithfully) semidualizing bimodule
$_S(K_{d-1})_R$, and then introduce and study the concepts of
$K_{d-1}$-$(n,d)$-injective (resp. $K_{d-1}$-$(n,d)$-flat) modules as a common
generalization of some known modules such as $C$-injective, $C$-weak injective
and $C$-$FP_n$-injective (resp. $C$-flat, $C$-weak flat and $C$-$FP_n$-flat)
modules. Then we obtain some characterizations of two classes of these modules,
namely $\mathcal{I}_{K_{d-1}}^{(n,d)}(R)$ and
$\mathcal{F}_{K_{d-1}}^{(n,d)}(S)$. We show that the cleasses
$\mathcal{I}_{K_{d-1}}^{(n,d)}(R)$ and $\mathcal{F}_{K_{d-1}}^{(n,d)}(S)$ are
covering and preenveloping. Also, we investigate Foxby equivalence relative to
the classes of this modules. Finally over $n$-coherent rings, we prove that the
classes $\mathcal{I}_{ K_{d-1}}^{(n,d)}(R)_{<\infty}$ and $\mathcal{F}_{
K_{d-1}}^{(n,d)}(S)_{<\infty}$ are closed under extentions, kernels of
epimorphisms and cokernels of monomorphisms.

An orthogonal perspective on Gauss composition,2025-11-06 02:17:47+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03987v1,"We revisit Gauss composition over a general base scheme, with a focus on
orthogonal groups. We show that the Clifford and norm functors provide a
discriminant-preserving equivalence of categories between binary quadratic
modules and pseudoregular modules over quadratic algebras. This perspective
synthesizes the constructions of Kneser and Wood, reconciling algebraic and
geometric approaches and clarifying the role of orientations and the natural
emergence of narrow class groups. As an application, we restrict to lattices

"Boundary-Localized Commutators and Cohomology of Shift Algebras on the Half-Lattice: Structure, Representations, and Extensions",2025-11-06 00:05:03+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03927v1,"We study the boundary-localized Lie algebra generated by the rank-one
perturbation \(T = U + \varepsilon E\) of the unilateral shift on

neighborhood of the boundary. We construct explicit site-localized 2-cocycles

A topological approach to discrete restriction semigroups and their algebras,2025-11-05 21:27:37+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03869v1,"We introduce a general framework, based on \'etale topological categories,
for studying discrete restriction semigroups and their algebras. Generalizing
Paterson's universal groupoid of an inverse semigroup, we define the universal
category ${\mathscr C}(S)$ of a restriction semigroup $S$ with local units as
the category of germs of the spectral action of $S$ on the character space of
its projection semilattice. This is an \'etale topological category, meaning
that its domain map is a local homeomorphism, while its range map is only
required to be continuous. We show that $S$ embeds into the universal Boolean
restriction semigroup of compact slices of ${\mathscr C}(S)$ and apply this
embedding to establish the following results:
  - a topological version of the ESN-type theorem for restriction semigroups by
Gould and Hollings;
  - an extension to restriction semigroups of the Petrich-Reilly structure
theorem for $E$-unitary inverse semigroups in terms of partial actions;
  - an isomorphism between the semigroup algebra of a restriction semigroup $S$
with local units and the convolution algebra of the universal category
${\mathscr C}(S)$, extending the seminal result by Steinberg.
  The paper is inspired by the work of Cockett and Garner and builds upon the
earlier research of the author. It shows that the theory of restriction
semigroups can be developed much further than was previously thought, as a
natural extension of the inverse semigroup theory.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03869v1,2511.03869v1,RA
Jacobi identities for Wronskian determinants over multidimension,2025-11-05 20:31:13+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03848v1,"The generalised Wronskian of differential order $k\geqslant 1$ for $N$

derivatives $\partial^{|\sigma_i|} f_j / \partial (x^1)^{\sigma_i^1}\cdots

Lie $n$-centralizers of von Neumann algebras,2025-11-05 14:56:47+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03523v1,"Let $\U$ be a von Neumann algebra with a projection $P\in \U$. For any
$A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n\in\U,$ define $p_1(A_1)=A_1,$ $p_n

On metacyclic p-group codes,2025-11-05 12:47:52+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03429v1,"In this article, we study the metacyclic p-group codes arising from finite
semisimple group algebras. In [CM25], we studied group codes arising from
metacyclic groups with order divisible by two distinct odd primes. In the
current work, we focus on metacyclic p-group codes, as a result of which we are
also able to extend the results of [CM25] for metacyclic groups with order
divisible by any two primes, not necessarily odd or distinct. Consequently,
existing results on group algebras of some important classes of groups,
including dihedral and quaternion groups, have been extended. Additionally, we
provide left codes for the undertaken group algebras. Finally, we construct
non-central codes using units motivated by Bass and bicyclic units, which are
inequivalent to any abelian group codes and yield best known parameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03429v1,2511.03429v1,RA
Tropicalization and cluster asymptotic phenomenon of generalized Markov equations,2025-11-05 12:45:08+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03428v1,"The generalized Markov equations are deeply connected with the generalized
cluster algebras of Markov type. We construct a deformed Fock-Goncharov
tropicalization for the generalized Markov equations and prove that their
tropicalized tree structure is essentially the same as that of the classical
Euclid tree. We then define the generalized Euclid tree and prove that it
converges to the classical Euclid tree up to a scalar multiple. Moreover, by
means of cluster mutations, we exhibit an asymptotic phenomenon, up to some
limit q, between the logarithmic generalized Markov tree and the classical
Euclid tree. A rationality conjecture of q is then put forward. We also propose
a generalized Markov uniqueness conjecture for the generalized Markov
equations, which illustrates an application of the asymptotic phenomenon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03428v1,2511.03428v1,RA

we exhibit the relationship between each one of these properties and the

Higher hereditary algebras and toric Fano stacks of Picard number one or two,2025-11-04 15:06:03+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02641v1,"We prove the existence and give a classification of all $d$-tilting bundles
(and thus geometric Helices) consisting of line bundles on $d$-dimensional
smooth toric Fano DM stacks of Picard number one or two. Here, a $d$-tilting
bundle is a tilting bundle whose endomorphism algebra has global dimension $d$
or less.
  In the case of Picard number one, tilting bundles consisting of line bundles
correspond bijectively to non-trivial upper sets in its Picard group equipped
with a certain partial order. Moreover, all of them are $d$-tilting bundles and
their endomorphisms algebras become $d$-representation infinite algebras of
type $\tilde{A}$. Conversely, all such algebras arise in this way. In this
sense, we can think of smooth toric Fano DM stacks with Picard number one as
geometric models of higher representation infinite algebras of type
$\tilde{A}$. Using this geometric model, we give a new combinatorial
description to $d$-APR tilting modules of them.
  In the case of Picard number two, $d$-tilting bundles consisting of line
bundles correspond bijectively to pairs $(I,I')$, where $I$ and $I'$ are
non-trivial upper sets in certain partially ordered sets. Here, $I$ corresponds
to a non-commutative crepant resolution (NCCR) of a certain Gorenstein toric
singularity with divisor class group of rank one and $I'$ corresponds to a cut
of the quiver of this NCCR. Moreover, the endomorphism algebras of these
$d$-tilting bundles also become $d$-representation infinite algebras.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02641v1,2511.02641v1,RA
Homological and Categorical Foundations of Ternary $Γ$-Modules and Their Spectra,2025-11-04 12:53:10+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02544v1,"Purpose: To develop a unified homological categorical foundation for
commutative ternary Gamma semirings by formulating a general theory of ternary
Gamma modules that integrates algebraic, geometric, and computational layers,
extending the ideal theoretic and algorithmic bases of Papers A [Rao2025A] and
B [Rao2025B1].
  Methods: We axiomatize ternary Gamma modules and establish the fundamental
isomorphism theorems, construct annihilator primitive correspondences, and
prove Schur density embeddings. Categorical analysis shows that T Gamma Mod is
additive, exact, and monoidal closed, enabling the definition of derived
functors Ext and Tor via projective injective resolutions and yielding a tensor
Hom adjunction. We develop geometric dualities between module objects and the
spectrum Spec Gamma (T) and extend them to analytic, fuzzy, and computational
settings.
  Results: The category T Gamma Mod admits kernels, cokernels, coequalizers,
and balanced exactness; monoidal closure ensures internal Homs and coherent
tensor Hom adjunctions. Derived functors Ext and Tor are well defined and
functorial, with long exact sequences and base change compatibility. Schur
density yields faithful embedding criteria, while annihilator primitive
correspondences control primitivity and support theory. Geometric dualities
provide contravariant equivalences linking submodule spectra with closed sets
in Spec Gamma (T), persisting under analytic, fuzzy, and computational
enrichments.
  Conclusion: These results complete the algebraic homological geometric
synthesis for commutative ternary Gamma semirings, furnish robust tools for
derived and spectral analysis, and prepare the framework for fuzzy and
computational extensions developed in Paper D [Rao2025D], extending the
algebraic framework first established in [Rao2025]",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02544v1,2511.02544v1,RA
Classifications of 3-dimensional cubic AS-regular algebras whose point schemes are not integral,2025-11-04 08:34:40+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02361v1,"In noncommutative algebraic geometry, Artin--Tate--Van den Bergh showed that

$\Gamma$-semirings by identifying their intrinsic invariants, lattice
organization, and radical behavior that generalize classical semiring and

  Methods: Finite models of commutative ternary $\Gamma$-semirings are
constructed under the axioms of closure, distributivity, and symmetry.
Structural and congruence lattices are analyzed, and subdirect decomposition
theorems are established through ideal-theoretic arguments.
  Results: Each finite commutative ternary $\Gamma$-semiring admits a unique
(up to isomorphism) decomposition into subdirectly irreducible components.
Radical and ideal correspondences parallel classical results for binary
semirings, while the classification of all non-isomorphic systems of order
$\lvert T\rvert\!\le\!4$ confirms the structural consistency of the theory.
  Conclusion: The paper provides a compact algebraic framework linking ideal
theory and decomposition in finite ternary $\Gamma$-semirings, establishing the

A Complete Classification of Ideal Chomp Games on Low-Rank Algebras,2025-11-03 15:37:49+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01673v1,"We completely classify winning strategies in the Ideal Chomp Game played on
