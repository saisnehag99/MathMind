Analyzing the topological structure of composite dynamical systems,2025-11-06 17:57:16+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04603v1,"This chapter explores dynamical structural equation models (DSEMs) and their
nonlinear generalizations into sheaves of dynamical systems. It demonstrates
these two disciplines on part of the food web in the Bering Sea. The
translation from DSEMs to sheaves passes through a formal construction borrowed
from electronics called a netlist that specifies how data route through a
system. A sheaf can be considered a formal hypothesis about how variables
interact, that then specifies how observations can be tested for consistency,
how missing data can be inferred, and how uncertainty about the observations
can be quantified. Sheaf modeling provides a coherent mathematical framework
for studying the interaction of various dynamical subsystems that together
determine a larger system.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04603v1,2511.04603v1,AT
"Embedding Calculus, Goodwillie Calculus and Link Invariants",2025-11-06 17:37:14+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04582v1,"We study Goodwillie-Weiss embedding calculus through its relationship with
Goodwillie's functor calculus. Specifically, building on a result of Tillmann
and Weiss, we construct a functorial complement for \(T_{n}\)-embeddings that
takes values in Heuts's categorical \(n\)-excisive approximation of pointed
spaces. We also establish an analogue of Stallings' theorem for lower central
series in the context of \(T_{n}\)-embeddings of \(P \times I\) into \(D^{d}\)
for any compact manifold \(P\). As an application, we show that the embedding
tower of string links detects Milnor invariants.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04582v1,2511.04582v1,AT
On the Vietoris-Rips Complexes of Integer Lattices,2025-11-06 10:23:45+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04238v1,"For a metric space $X$ and $r \geq 0$, the Vietoris-Rips complex
$\mathcal{VR}(X;r)$ is a simplicial complex whose simplices are finite subsets
of $X$ with diameter at most $r$. Vietoris-Rips complexes have applications in
various places, including data analysis, geometric group theory, sensor
networks, etc. Consider the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ as a metric space
equipped with the $d_1$-metric (the Manhattan metric or standard word metric in
the Cayley graph). Ziga Virk proved that if either $r \geq n^2(2n-1)$, or
$1\leq n \leq 3$ and $r \geq n$, then the complex
$\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible, and posed a question if
$\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible for all $r \geq n$. Recently,
Matthew Zaremsky improved Ziga's result and proved that
$\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible if $r \geq n^2+ n-1$. Further,
he conjectured that $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible for all $r
\geq n$. We prove Zaremsky's conjecture for $n \leq 5$, i.e., we prove that
$\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible if $n \leq 5$ and $r \geq n$.
Further, we prove that $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible for $r
\geq 10$.
  We determine the homotopy type of $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;2)$, and show
that these complexes are homotopy equivalent to a wedge of countably infinite
copies of $\mathbb{S}^3$. We also show that $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is
simply connected for $r \geq 2$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04238v1,2511.04238v1,AT
Cyclic brace relation and BV structure on open-closed Hochschild cohomology,2025-11-06 06:19:41+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04095v1,"For an open-closed homotopy algebra (OCHA), the previous work indicates that
there is an open-closed version of Hochschild cohomology with a canonical
Gerstenhaber algebra structure. If this OCHA is further cyclic and unital in
the sense of Kajiura and Stasheff, we produce a BV algebra structure on this
cohomology via a cochain-level identity formulated with cyclic brace
operations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04095v1,2511.04095v1,AT
Vectorized Computation of Euler Characteristic Functions and Transforms,2025-11-05 23:15:31+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03909v1,"The weighted Euler characteristic transform (WECT) and Euler characteristic
function (ECF) have proven to be useful tools in a variety of applications.
However, current methods for computing these functions are neither optimized
for speed nor do they scale to higher-dimensional settings. In this work, we
present a vectorized framework for computing such topological transforms using
tensor operations, which is highly optimized for GPU architectures and works in
full generality across geometric simplicial complexes (or cubical complexes) of
arbitrary dimension. Experimentally, the framework demonstrates significant
speedups (up to $180 \times$) over existing methods when computing the WECT and
ECF across a variety of image datasets. Computation of these transforms is
implemented in a publicly available Python package called pyECT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03909v1,2511.03909v1,AT
Every group retraction can be realized as a topological retraction,2025-11-05 13:53:15+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03472v1,"Given a group retraction $r: G \rightarrow H $, we construct a finite
topological space $ X_r $ of height 1, together with a topological retraction
$\overline{r}: X_r \rightarrow X_r $, such that the group of automorphisms $
\mathrm{Aut}(X_r) $ (or the group of self-homotopy equivalences $
\mathcal{E}(X_r) $) of $X_r$ is isomorphic to $ G $, and $
\mathrm{Aut}(\overline{r}(X_r)) $ (or $\mathcal{E}(\overline{r}(X_r)) $) is
isomorphic to $ H$. Moreover, there is a natural map $\overline{r}' :
\mathrm{Aut}(X_r) \rightarrow \mathrm{Aut}(\overline{r}(X_r)) $ that coincides
with the original group retraction $ r $. As a direct consequence of this
construction, we show that height 1 is the minimal height required to realize
any finite group as the group of automorphisms (or the group of self-homotopy
equivalences) of a finite topological space, except in the case where $ G $ is
a symmetric group. In that unique case, the group can be realized by a finite
topological space of height 0.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03472v1,2511.03472v1,AT
Simplicial Homology Groups,2025-11-05 09:44:58+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03326v1,"This expository article presents a self-contained introduction to simplicial
homology for finite simplicial complexes, emphasizing concrete computation and
geometric intuition. Beginning with orientations of simplices and the
construction of free abelian chain groups, the boundary operators are defined
via the alternating-sum formula and shown to satisfy the chain-complex identity
that the boundary of a boundary vanishes. Cycles and boundaries are then
developed as kernels and images of the boundary maps, leading to homology
groups that capture connected components, independent loops, and
higher-dimensional voids. Throughout, detailed low-dimensional examples and
step-by-step matrix calculations illustrate how to form boundary matrices,
compute kernels and images, and identify generators and relations in \(H_p\).
The presentation highlights universal properties of chain groups, clarifies
sign conventions and induced orientations, and demonstrates the invariance of
homology under combinatorial refinements, thereby connecting geometric features
of spaces to computable algebraic invariants.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03326v1,2511.03326v1,AT
The Formal Context of Saturated Transfer Systems on Finite Abelian Groups,2025-11-04 20:41:34+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02982v1,"We describe the reduced formal context of the lattice of saturated transfer
systems on a finite abelian group. As an application, we compute that there are
13,784,538,270,571 saturated transfer systems on the elementary abelian group
$C_5^3$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02982v1,2511.02982v1,AT
Koszulity of a certain properad,2025-11-04 18:56:39+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02829v1,"We establish that the properad $Y^{(n)}$, encoding bialgebras with a product
of degree zero, a coproduct of degree $(1-n)$ and a rank three cyclic tensor,
which satisfy a deformed version of the balanced infinitesimal bialgebra
condition, is Koszul. This result is established by geometric methods, by
studying cellular chain complexes of moduli spaces of a certain type of
meromorphic quadratic differential on $\mathbb{CP}^1$, which we call cloven
Strebel differentials. Using this geometric interpretation we can control the
topology of these spaces, establishing vanishing of higher cohomology of the
relevant bar complexes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02829v1,2511.02829v1,AT
Abstract representation theory via coherent Auslander-Reiten diagrams,2025-11-04 16:55:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02731v1,"We provide a general method to study representations of quivers over abstract
stable homotopy theories (e.g. arbitrary rings, schemes, dg algebras, or ring
spectra) in terms of Auslander-Reiten diagrams. For a finite acyclic quiver $Q$
and a stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, we prove an abstract equivalence
of the representations $\mathcal{C}^Q$ with a certain mesh $\infty$-category
$\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{Z}Q,\, \mathrm{mesh}}$ of representations of the
repetitive quiver $\mathbb{Z}Q$, that we build inductively using abstract
reflection functors. This allows to produce, from the symmetries of the
Auslander-Reiten quiver, universal autoequivalences of representations
$\mathcal{C}^Q$ in any stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, which are the
elements of the spectral Picard group of $Q$. In particular, we get abstract
versions of key functors in classical representation theory -- e.g. reflection
functors, the Auslander-Reiten translation, the Serre functor, etc. Moreover,
for representations of trees this enables us to realize the whole derived
Picard group over a field as a factor of the spectral Picard group.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02731v1,2511.02731v1,AT
Proper kernels in microlocal sheaf theory,2025-11-04 15:58:14+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02677v1,"Let $X$ and $Y$ be real analytic manifolds and let $\Lambda \subseteq T^*X$
and $\Sigma \subseteq T^*Y$ be closed conic subanalytic singular isotropics.
Given a sheaf $K \in \mathrm{Sh}_{-\Lambda \times \Sigma}(X \times Y)$
microsupported in $-\Lambda \times \Sigma$, consider the convolution functor
$(-) \ast K \colon \mathrm{Sh}_{\Lambda}(X) \rightarrow
\mathrm{Sh}_{\Sigma}(Y)$ from sheaves microsupported in $\Lambda$ to sheaves
microsupported in $\Sigma$. We show that the convolution functor $(-) \ast K$
preserves compact objects if and only if for each $x \in X$, the restriction
$K|_{\{x\} \times Y} \in \mathrm{Sh}_\Sigma(Y)$ is a compact object. By a
result of Kuo-Li, the functor sending a sheaf kernel $K$ to the convolution
functor $(-) \ast K$ is an equivalence between the category
$\mathrm{Sh}_{-\Lambda \times \Sigma}(X \times Y)$ of sheaves microsupported in
$-\Lambda \times \Sigma$ and the category of cocontinuous functors from
$\mathrm{Sh}_\Lambda(X)$ to $\mathrm{Sh}_\Sigma(Y)$. We therefore classify all
cocontinuous functors that preserve compact objects between the two categories.
Our approach is entirely categorical and requires minimal input from geometry:
we introduce the notion of a proper object in a compactly generated stable
infinity-category and study its properties under strongly continuous
localizations to obtain the result. The main geometric input is the analysis of
compact and proper objects of the category of $P$-constructible sheaves for a
triangulation $P$ of a manifold $Z$ via the exit path category
$\mathrm{Exit}(Z, P) \simeq P$. Along the way, we show that a sheaf $F \in
\mathrm{Sh}_\Lambda(X)$ is proper if and only if it has perfect stalks, which
is equivalent to a result of Nadler.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02677v1,2511.02677v1,AT
Fundamental groups of small simplicial complexes,2025-11-04 14:03:37+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02586v1,"The number of nonisomorphic simplicial complexes with up to $n$ vertices
increases super-exponentially with $n$, which makes exhaustive computation of
invariants associated with such complexes a daunting task. In this paper we
provide a complete list of groups that arise as fundamental groups of
simplicial complexes with at most $8$ vertices. In addition we give many
examples of fundamental groups of complexes with $9$ vertices although the
complete classification seems to be beyond reach at the moment.
  Our results lead to many applications, including progress on the
Bj\""orner-Lutz conjecture regarding vertex-minimal triangulations of the
Poincar\'e homology sphere, improved recognition criteria for PL triangulations
of manifolds and computation of the Karoubi-Weibel invariant for many groups.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02586v1,2511.02586v1,AT
Equivariant cohomology of juggling varieties in rank one,2025-11-04 14:02:52+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02585v1,"We determine the ring structure of the torus-equivariant cohomology of
rank-one juggling varieties with rational coefficients. By realizing these
varieties as cyclic quiver Grassmannians, we construct a Knutson--Tao type

The real cycle class isomorphism for linear schemes,2025-11-04 12:59:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02549v1,"The real cycle class map $H^i(X,\underline{I}^j(\mathcal{L})) \rightarrow
H^i_\text{sing}(X(\mathbb{R}),\mathbb{Z}(\mathcal{L}))$ is an isomorphism for
$j\geq \dim(X)+1$ for any scheme $X$ over $\mathbb{R}$ by a result of Jacobson.
It is also known to be an isomorphism for $j\geq i$, the earliest possible
case, if $X$ is cellular due to Hornbostel-Wendt-Xie-Zibrowius. This paper
generalizes their result to linear schemes, providing (precise) intermediate
bounds on the range, where the real cycle class map is an isomorphism.
Moreover, we show that Lerbet's conjectured upper bound for the exponent of the
cokernel of $H^i(X,\underline{I}^i(\mathcal{L})) \rightarrow
H^i_\text{sing}(X(\mathbb{R}),\mathbb{Z}(\mathcal{L}))$ cannot be improved.

A computation of $THH_*(ku)$ using a gathered spectral sequence,2025-11-04 08:11:02+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02346v1,"In this article, we extend the computation of topological Hochschild homology
(THH) of the Adams summand $\ell$ of $p$-localized connective complex
topological K-theory ($ku$) to THH of $ku$ itself. We leverage the relation
$u^{p-1} = v_1$, where $u$ is a generator of $ku_*$ and $v_1$ is a generator of
$\ell_*$, and we consider the cofiber of the multiplication by $v_1$ in $ku$,
denoted $ku/v_1$. We use the morphism between the Bockstein spectral sequence
of the multiplication by $v_1$ computing $THH_*(\ell)$ and $THH_*(ku)$; we
develop a general technique using what we term a gathered spectral sequence
that allows us to explore the relationship between the Bockstein spectral
sequence for the multiplications by $v_1$ and $u$, yielding a computation of
$THH_*(ku)$. Our method is not only applicable to this specific problem but
also potentially useful in other computations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02346v1,2511.02346v1,AT
Revisiting the $β_1$-action on the $3$-primary stable homotopy groups of spheres,2025-11-04 07:21:10+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02324v1,"Let $\beta_1$ be the first $3$-torsion class in the stable homotopy groups of

$\beta_1$, written as $\{\beta_{1+9s}\}_{s\geq 0}$, and showed that any
$5$-fold product $\prod_5 \beta_{1+9s} \neq 0$, whilst all $6$-fold products
$\prod_6 \beta_{1+9s} = 0$. In this article, we give a simple proof of these

Families of Arcs in 4-Manifolds and Maps of Configuration Spaces,2025-11-03 22:50:07+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02111v1,"In this thesis we construct 3-parameter families $G(p,q,r)$ of embedded arcs
with fixed boundary in a 4-manifold. We then analyze these elements of
$\pi_3\mathsf{Emb}_\partial(I,M)$ using embedding calculus by studying the
induced map from the embedding space to ``Taylor approximations""
$T_k\mathsf{Emb}_\partial(I,M)$. We develop a diagrammatic framework inspired
by cubical $\omega$-groupoids to depict $G(p,q,r)$ and related homotopies. We
use this framework extensively in Chapter 4 to show explicitly that $G(p,q,r)$
is trivial in $\pi_3T_3\mathsf{Emb}_\partial(I,M)$ (however, we conjecture that
it is non-trivial in $\pi_3T_4\mathsf{Emb}_\partial(I,M)$). In Chapter 5 we use
the Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence for homotopy groups of cosimplicial spaces
to show that the rational homotopy group
$\pi^{\mathbb{Q}}_3\mathsf{Emb}_\partial(I,S^1 \times B^3)$ is $\mathbb{Q}$.

A Steenrod Square for Link Floer Homology,2025-11-03 19:14:09+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02000v1,"Recently, Manolescu-Sarkar constructed a stable homotopy type for link Floer

lower-dimensional moduli spaces of the Manolescu-Sarkar construction as well as
the more general moduli spaces corresponding to the full grid. Though in the
latter case the stable homotopy type is not known, the explicit framings are
enough to construct a framed 1-flow category, a construction by
