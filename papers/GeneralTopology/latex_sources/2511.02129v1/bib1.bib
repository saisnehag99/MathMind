abstract = {We introduce the category of almost alternating links: nonalternating links which have a projection for which one crossing change yields an alternating projection. We extend this category to m-almost alternating links which require m crossing changes to yield an alternating projection. We show that all but five of the nonalternating knots up through eleven crossings and links up through ten crossing are almost alternating. We also prove that a prime almost alternating knot is either a hyperbolic knot or a torus knot. We then obtain a bound on the span of the bracket polynomial for m-almost alternating links and discuss applications.}

abstract = {Knots and entanglements are ubiquitous. Beyond their aesthetic appeal, these fascinating topological entities can be either useful or cumbersome. In recent decades, the importance and prevalence of molecular knots have been increasingly recognised by scientists from different disciplines. In this review, we provide an overview on the various molecular knots found in naturally occurring biological systems (DNA, RNA and proteins), and those created by synthetic chemists. We discuss the current knowledge in these fields, including recent developments in experimental and, in some cases, computational studies which are beginning to shed light into the complex interplay between the structure, formation and properties of these topologically intricate molecules.}
