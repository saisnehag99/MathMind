The $D$-graded Proj construction provides a general framework for constructing schemes from rings graded by finitely generated abelian groups $D$, yet its properties and applications remain underdeveloped compared to the classical $\BN$-graded case. This paper establishes the essential characteristics of $D$-graded rings $S$, like the distinction between $D$-homogeneous prime ideals and $D$-prime ideals if $D$ has torsion. We particularly focus on describing the quotient by the associated group scheme, generalizing the construction of a toric variety from its Cox ring.
As in the $\BN$-graded construction, the basic affine opens of the Proj construction are given in terms of degree-zero localizations $S_{(f)}$, where $f$ in $S$ homogeneous is \emph{relevant}.
We prove that  $\pi_f: \Spec(S_f) \to \Spec(S_{(f)})$ is a geometric quotient under mild finiteness assumptions if $f$ is relevant, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for this map to be a pseudo $\Spec(S_0[D])$-torsor.
