The weighted Euler characteristic transform (WECT) and 
Euler characteristic function~(ECF)
have proven to be useful tools in a variety of applications.
%
However, current methods for computing these functions are neither optimized for
speed nor do they
scale to higher-dimensional settings.
%
In this work, we present a vectorized framework for computing such topological transforms using tensor operations,
which is highly optimized for GPU architectures and works in full generality across geometric 
simplicial complexes (or cubical complexes) of arbitrary dimension.
%
Experimentally, the framework demonstrates significant speedups (up to $180 \times$) over existing methods 
when computing the WECT and ECF across a variety of image datasets.
%
Computation of these transforms is implemented in a publicly available Python
package called \pyect.\footnote{
