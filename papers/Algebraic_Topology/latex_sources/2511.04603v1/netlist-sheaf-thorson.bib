	abstract = {Ecological dynamics are analyzed across multiple sites, times, and variables. Here, we introduce the family of generalized graphical mixed models (GGMMs) and show that it extends structural equation, generalized additive, and generalized linear mixed models. GGMMs represent ecological systems using a mathematical graph, where each analytic unit (node for each site-time-variable) has a direct effect on other units via specified linear interactions (edges). This graph is composed by combining elementary ecological relationships like ecological interactions, evolutionary trade-offs, time-lags, and spatial diffusion. GGMMs are then expressed using simultaneous equations, efficiently estimated using Gaussian Markov random fields, and used for prediction, inference, and causal analysis. We demonstrate GGMMs using three contrasting case studies: tracking cohorts in age-structured models; phylogenetic path analysis; and diffusion-enhanced spatio-temporal models. We conclude that GGMMs connect ecological theory with statistical models that are applied for inference, prediction, and causal analysis throughout ecology.},

	abstract = {Spatial Ecology addresses the fundamental effects of space on the dynamics of individual species and on the structure, dynamics, diversity, and stability of multispecies communities. Although the ecological world is unavoidably spatial, there have been few attempts to determine how explicit considerations of space may alter the predictions of ecological models, or what insights it may give into the causes of broad-scale ecological patterns. As this book demonstrates, the spatial structure of a habitat can fundamentally alter both the qualitative and quantitative dynamics and outcomes of ecological processes. Spatial Ecology highlights the importance of space to five topical areas: stability, patterns of diversity, invasions, coexistence, and pattern generation. It illustrates both the diversity of approaches used to study spatial ecology and the underlying similarities of these approaches. Over twenty contributors address issues ranging from the persistence of endangered species, to the maintenance of biodiversity, to the dynamics of hosts and their parasitoids, to disease dynamics, multispecies competition, population genetics, and fundamental processes relevant to all these cases. There have been many recent advances in our understanding of the influence of spatially explicit processes on individual species and on multispecies communities. This book synthesizes these advances, shows the limitations of traditional, non-spatial approaches, and offers a variety of new approaches to spatial ecology that should stimulate ecological research.},

Abstract
Density dependence in population growth rates is of immense importance to ecological theory and application, but is difficult to estimate. The Global Population Dynamics Database (GPDD), one of the largest collections of population time series available, has been extensively used to study cross-taxa patterns in density dependence. A major difficulty with assessing density dependence from time series is that uncertainty in population abundance estimates can cause strong bias in both tests and estimates of strength. We analyse 627 data sets in the GPDD using Gompertz population models and account for uncertainty via the Kalman filter. Results suggest that at least 45\% of the time series display density dependence, but that it is weak and difficult to detect for a large fraction. When uncertainty is ignored, magnitude of and evidence for density dependence is strong, illustrating that uncertainty in abundance estimates qualitatively changes conclusions about density dependence drawn from the GPDD.},

Variation along the spectrum of intraspecific competition, with contest and scramble competition as endpoints, leads to vastly different responses to population density. Here we investigated the diversity of intraspecific competition among fish species, predicting that functional forms of density-dependent reproduction would be conserved in related taxa. Using a hierarchical model that links stock–recruitment parameters among populations, species, and orders, we found that the strength of overcompensation, and therefore the type of intraspecific competition, is tightly clustered within taxonomic groupings, as species within an order share similar degrees of compensation. Specifically, species within the orders Salmoniformes and Pleuronectiformes exhibited density dependence indicative of scramble competition (overcompensation) while the orders Clupeiformes, Gadiformes, Perciformes, and Scorpaeniformes exhibited dynamics consistent with contest competition (compensation). Maximum potential recruitment also varied among orders, but with less clustering across species. We also tested whether stock–recruitment parameters correlated with maximum body length among species, but found no strong relationship. Our results suggest that much of the variation in the form of density-dependent reproduction among fish species may be predicted taxonomically due to evolved life history traits and reproductive behaviors.},

Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interventions, (also called “causal effects” or “policy evaluation”) (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of “regret,” “attribution” or “causes of effects”) and (3) queries about direct and indirect effects (also known as “mediation”). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.},

	abstract = {In 2014, the Bering Sea shifted back to warmer ocean temperatures (+2 oC above average), bringing concern for the potential for a new warm stanza and broad biological and ecological cascading effects. In 2015 and 2016 dedicated surveys were executed to study the progression of ocean heating and ecosystem response. We describe ecosystem response to multiple, consecutive years of ocean warming and offer perspective on the broader impacts. Ecosystem changes observed include reduced spring phytoplankton biomass over the southeast Bering Sea shelf relative to the north, lower abundances of large-bodied crustacean zooplankton taxa, and degraded feeding and body condition of age-0 walleye pollock. This suggests poor ecosystem conditions for young pollock production and the risk of significant decline in the number of pollock available to the pollock fishery in 2–3 years. However, we also noted that high quality prey, large copepods and euphausiids, and lower temperatures in the north may have provided a refuge from poor conditions over the southern shelf, potentially buffering the impact of a sequential-year warm stanza on the Bering Sea pollock population. We offer the hypothesis that juvenile (age-0, age-1) pollock may buffer deleterious warm stanza effects by either utilizing high productivity waters associated with the strong, northerly Cold Pool, as a refuge from the warm, low production areas of the southern shelf, or by exploiting alternative prey over the southern shelf. We show that in 2015, the ocean waters influenced by spring sea ice (the Cold Pool) supported robust phytoplankton biomass (spring) comprised of centric diatom chains, a crustacean copepod community comprised of large-bodied taxa (spring, summer), and a large aggregation of midwater fishes, potentially young pollock. In this manner, the Cold Pool may have acted as a trophic refuge in that year. The few age-0 pollock occurring over the southeast shelf consumed high numbers of euphausiids which may have provided a high quality alternate prey. In 2016 a retracted Cold Pool precluded significant refuging in the north, though pollock foraging on available euphausiids over the southern shelf may have mitigated the effect of warm waters and reduced large availability of large copepods. This work presents the hypothesis that, in the short term, juvenile pollock can mitigate the drastic impacts of sustained warming. This short-term buffering, combined with recent observations (2017) of renewed sea ice presence over southeast Bering Sea shelf and a potential return to average or at least cooler ecosystem conditions, suggests that recent warm year stanza (2014–2016) effects to the pollock population and fishery may be mitigated.},

Here, we combine multifrequency acoustic survey methods, physics-based models of euphausiid backscatter, and net sampling to provide a means of monitoring the status and trends of euphausiid standing stock biomass on the Bering Sea shelf. Observations made using this approach during six summers (2004 and 2006–2010) indicate that standing stocks of euphausiids and pollock were inversely correlated over time as well as in space across the continental shelf. First-order calculations show that when pollock abundance was at its peak during these years, the pollock stock could have consumed 10–87\% of the euphausiid standing stock between May and September. We hypothesize that predation by pollock is a significant top-down control on euphausiid standing stock in this system.},

Various scattering models exist to convert acoustic backscatter data to estimates of euphausiid numerical density or biomass, but a target strength (TS) model specific to Bering Sea euphausiids has not been available. This study parameterized a distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) scattering model using physical (length and body shape) and material (density contrast, g, and sound speed contrast, h) properties measured from live euphausiids. All model parameters (length, shape, material properties, orientation) were evaluated for their effect on predicted TS. A polynomial function was used to describe animal shape and produced smaller TS estimates compared to a taper function, as is traditionally used in DWBA scattering models of euphausiids. Animal length was positively correlated with TS, but variations in other parameters (including material properties and orientation) also produced large changes in TS. Large differences in TS between estimates calculated using measured versus literature material property values caused large variations in acoustic estimates of euphausiid numerical densities (animals m−3) which emphasizes the importance of collecting site-specific g and h measurements when possible.},

Climate impacts on eastern Bering Sea foodwebs: a synthesis of new data and an assessment of the Oscillating Control Hypothesis. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 1230–1243.Walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) is an important component of the eastern Bering Sea ecosystem and subject to major fisheries. The Oscillating Control Hypothesis (OCH) predicted that recruitment of pollock year classes should be greatest in years with early ice retreat and late blooms in warm water, because more energy would flow into the pelagic (vs. benthic) community. The OCH further predicted that, with pollock population growth, there should be a shift from bottom-up to top-down regulation. New data support the predictions that in those years with early ice retreat, more primary production accrues to the pelagic compartment and that large numbers of age-0 pollock survive to summer. However, in these years, production of large crustacean zooplankton is reduced, depriving age-0 pollock of lipid-rich prey in summer and autumn. Consequently, age-0 pollock energy reserves (depot lipids) are low and predation on them is increased as fish switch to age-0 pollock from zooplankton. The result is weak recruitment of age-1 recruits the following year. A revised OCH indicates bottom-up constraints on pollock recruitment in very warm periods. Prolonged warm periods with decreased ice cover will likely cause diminished pollock recruitment and catches relative to recent values.},

Results indicate that Calanus can reach its maximum size during both cold and warm years, but during warm winters, they will exhaust their lipid reserves during diapause by the end of December. During cold years Calanus can last into May of the following spring. Ice algae may provide a rich food source in March and April during cold years, before the spring phytoplankton bloom in May.

The advice from statisticians for scientists employing multimodel inference is to develop a well-thought-out set of candidate models for comparison, though precise instructions for how to do that are typically not given. A coherent body of knowledge, which falls under the general term causal analysis, now exists for examining the explanatory scientific content of candidate models. Much of the literature on causal analysis has been recently developed, and we suspect may not be familiar to many ecologists. This body of knowledge comprises a set of graphical tools and axiomatic principles to support scientists in their endeavors to create “well-formed hypotheses,” as statisticians are asking them to do. Causal analysis is complementary to methods such as structural equation modeling, which provides the means for evaluation of proposed hypotheses against data. In this paper, we summarize and illustrate a set of principles that can guide scientists in their quest to develop explanatory hypotheses for evaluation. The principles presented in this paper have the capacity to close the communication gap between statisticians, who urge scientists to develop well-thought-out coherent models, and scientists, who would like some practical advice for exactly how to do that.},

	abstract = {Ecological analyses typically involve many interacting variables. Ecologists often specify lagged interactions in community dynamics (i.e. vector-autoregressive models) or simultaneous interactions (e.g. structural equation models), but there is less familiarity with dynamic structural equation models (DSEM) that can include any simultaneous or lagged effect in multivariate time-series analysis. We propose a novel approach to parameter estimation for DSEM, which involves constructing a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) representing simultaneous and lagged path coefficients, and then fitting this as a generalized linear mixed model to missing and/or non-normal data. We provide a new R-package dsem, which extends the ‘arrow interface’ from path analysis to represent user-specified lags when constructing the GMRF. We also outline how the resulting nonseparable precision matrix can generalize existing separable models, for example, for time-series and species interactions in a vector-autoregressive model. We first demonstrate dsem by simulating a two-species vector-autoregressive model based on wolf–moose interactions on Isle Royale. We show that DSEM has improved precision when data are missing relative to a conventional dynamic linear model. We then demonstrate DSEM via two contrasting case studies. The first identifies a trophic cascade where decreased sunflower starfish has increased urchin and decreased kelp densities, while sea otters have a simultaneous positive effect on kelp in the California Current from 1999 to 2018. The second estimates how declining sea ice has decreased cold-water habitats, driving a decreased density for fall copepod predation and inhibiting early-life survival for Alaska pollock from 1963 to 2023. We conclude that DSEM can be fitted efficiently as a GLMM involving missing data, while allowing users to specify both simultaneous and lagged effects in a time-series structural model. DSEM then allows conceptual models (developed with stakeholder input or from ecological expertise) to be fitted to incomplete time series and provides a simple interface for granular control over the number of estimated time-series parameters. Finally, computational methods are sufficiently simple that DSEM can be embedded as component within larger (e.g. integrated population) models. We therefore recommend greater exploration and performance testing for DSEM relative to familiar time-series forecasting methods.},

	abstract = {Ecologists are often interested in answering causal questions from observational data but generally lack the training to appropriately infer causation. When applying statistical analysis (e.g., generalized linear model) on observational data, common statistical adjustments can often lead to biased estimates between variables of interest due to processes such as confounding, overcontrol, and collider bias. To overcome these limitations, we present an overview of structural causal modeling (SCM), an emerging causal inference framework that can be used to determine cause-and-effect relationships from observational data. The SCM framework uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to visualize researchers' assumptions about the causal structure of a system or process under study. Following this, a DAG-based graphical rule known as the backdoor criterion can be applied to determine statistical adjustments (or lack thereof) required to determine causal relationships from observational data. In the presence of unobserved confounding variables, an additional rule called the frontdoor criterion can be employed to determine causal effects. Here, we use simulated ecological examples to review how the backdoor and frontdoor criteria can return accurate causal estimates between variables of interest, as well as how biases can arise when these criteria are not used. We further provide an overview of studies that have applied the SCM framework in ecology. SCM, along with its application of DAGs, has been widely used in other disciplines to make valid causal inferences from observational data. Their use in ecology holds tremendous potential for quantifying causal relationships and investigating a range of ecological questions without randomized experiments.},

At stock densities beyond the apex, reproduction declines either gradually or abruptly. This decline gives a population a tendency to oscillate in numbers; however, the oscillations are damped, not permanent, unless reproduction decreases quite rapidly and there is not too much mixing of generations in the breeding population. Removal of part of the adult stock reduces the amplitude of oscillations that may be in progress and, up to a point, increases reproduction.},
