\subsection{Leveled buildings}\label{subsec:leveled-gluing} For the flow category, it is important to use leveled buildings and not Pardon buildings. Thus, we prove here that our global Kuranishi charts constructed in \textsection\ref{subsec:construction} also yield global Kuranishi charts for the buildings classically used in SFT.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:leveled-gkc}
 Suppose $\Gamma^\pm$ are collections of Reeb orbits of total action $ < L$, $\beta$ is a relative homology class, and $\alpha$ is a perturbation datum for $\Mbar^{\, J}(\Gamma^+,\Gamma^-;\beta)$. Then $$\cK^\bR \coloneqq\cBS\times_{\cBR}\cK_\alpha$$ is a global Kuranishi chart with corners for the moduli space $\Mbar_{\sft}^{\, J}(\Gamma^+,\Gamma^-;\beta)$ of leveled SFT buildings. 
\end{theorem}

The proof relies heavily on our adaptation of the gluing theorem in \cite{Par19}, developed in \textsection\ref{sec:gluing}. We first start with a discussion of local charts in the corner blow-up $\cBS$ of $\cBR$ and then prove Proposition~\ref{prop:gluing-level} which is the key ingredient for Theorem~\ref{thm:leveled-gkc}.


\subsubsection{Local charts for $\cBS$}\label{dsc: gluing}
Let $\varphi \in \cBR$ and by abuse of notation let $\cBR|_{T_\varphi}$ denote a small neighborhood of $\varphi$ in the stratum corresponding to the tree type $T_\varphi$. Recall that the gluing results \ref{ssc:base_gluing} prove that for a small enough $\cBR|_{T_\varphi}$, there is a local chart $$g_b\cl G_{T_\varphi} \times \cBR|_{T_\varphi} \to \cBR.$$
Recall from the discussion below Theorem~\ref{thm:corner-blowup} that points in $\cBS$ correspond to points in $\cB$ along with additional data coming from the normal bundles to the corner strata that are blown up. Concretely, an element $p \in \cBS$ lying over the intersection $D_I = \cap_{i\in I} D_i$ of divisors is given by 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lift-corner-blow-up}
p = (y, [v_1],\dots,[v_I], [v'_{1,1}\oplus\dots\oplus v'_{1,k_1}],, \dots,  [v'_{\ell,1}\dots\dots\oplus v'_{\ell,k_\ell}]) 
\end{equation}
where $y\in D_I$ and $v_i,v_i' \in (N_{D_i/\cB})_y$ are related by a positive scaling. We thus can make the following observation.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:tangent-vectors-give-lift}
    Given $\varphi\in \cBR$ with underlying decorated tree $T$, a choice of tangent vector $\{s_{v,e}\}_{v\in V(T),e\in E^{\normalfont\text{int}}_v}$ at each marked point determines a lift $\wt\varphi\in \cBS$ of $\varphi$.\qed 
\end{lemma}

Let $(T_\varphi,\ell)$ be the underlying leveled tree of $\wt\varphi$. Then, a sufficiently small neighborhood of $ \wt\varphi$ in the fiber $\cBS|_{\varphi}$ of the blow-down map is diffeomorphic to $ \prod_{j = 1}^{\max\ell}(\Delta^{\#\ell\inv(j)-1})^{\text{int}}$ by the natural isomorphism 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:simplex-interior}
    (\Delta^{k} )^{\text{int}}\, \cong \,(\bR_{>0})^{k+1} /\bR_{>0}.
\end{equation}
The stratum carries a natural action of $(\prod_{i=1}^k\bR^{e\ell\inv(i)}_{>0},\times)$, given by scaling the $v_*'$ terms in~\eqref{eq:lift-corner-blow-up}. We will show that a local chart $g_b\cl G_{T_\varphi} \times \cBR|_{T_\varphi} \to \cBR$ centered at $\varphi$ can be lifted to give a local chart centered at $\wt\varphi$ in the leveled base space $\cBS$. To this end, let $k  = \max\ell -1 $ be the number of `gaps' between levels. The level function induces a function $el \cl E(T_\varphi) \to \bN$ by the relation 
$$e\ell(e) = \ell(v') $$
when $e =(v,v')$ with $\ell(v') > \ell(v)$.
There is a natural embedding,
$$ \varDelta\cl [0,1)^k \times \prod_{j = 1}^{\max\ell}(\Delta^{\#\ell\inv(j)-1})^{\text{int}}\hookrightarrow G_{T_\varphi/}$$  
defined by $$\varDelta(t_1,\dots,t_k,w_1,\dots,w_{k}) = (\Delta^{w_1}_{e\ell\inv(1)} (t_1) , \Delta^{w_2}_{e\ell\inv(2)} (t_2), \dots , \Delta^{w_k}_{e\ell\inv(k)} (t_k))   $$  where $\Delta^{w_i}_{e\ell\inv(i)}(x)$ is the linear embedding of the ray $[0,1) \mapsto [0,1)^{e\ell\inv(i)}$  corresponding to the point $w_i$ in the simplex $\Delta^{\# \ell\inv(i)-1}$. Here we use the extension of~\eqref{eq:simplex-interior} to an isomorphism $$\bR_+^k / \bR_{>0} \cong \Delta^{k-1}.$$ 
See Figure~\ref{fig:blowup2} for a pictorial description.

% \noindent  We will choose a local chart in the base 
% \[g_b \cl G_{T_{\varphi}/}  \times \cBR|_{T_{\varphi}}\,\xra{\simeq} \, V\]  near $\varphi \in \cBR$ based on the chosen cylindrical charts on $C_\varphi$ as explained in \S \ref{ssc:base_gluing}. The only difference is that while performing gauge-fixing of the target to obtain a lift of $[u_0],$ we pick maps $(u_0)_v$ such that it is a lift of the leveled building $u_0$ which we explain in more details below.

\begin{lemma}
There exists a diffeomorphism $lg_b$ making
\begin{equation}\label{dig:square-base}
\begin{tikzcd}
 {[}0,1)^k\times \prod_{j = 1}^{\max\ell}(\Delta^{\#\ell\inv(j)-1})^{\text{int}}\times \cBR|_{T_\varphi}\arrow[rr,  "lg_b"] \arrow[d,"\varDelta\times\ide"] && V^\bR \arrow[d] \\
 G_{T_\varphi/}\times  \cBR|_{T_\varphi}\quad\arrow[rr, "g_b"] && \cBR 
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
into a Cartesian square, up to shrinking $\cBR|_{T_{\varphi}}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    This follows from the explicit local description of the generalized blow-up in \cite[\textsection3]{KM15} and our identification of the fiber $\cBS|_{\varphi}$ with the product of interiors of simplices.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Leveled thickening}\label{leveled-thickening}
Fix two collections $\Gamma^\pm$ of Reeb orbits of total action $< L$ and let $\alpha$ be a perturbation datum for the moduli space $\Mbar^{\, J}(\Gamma^+,\Gamma^-;\beta)$ of Pardon buildings of degree $\beta$. Let $\cK = \cK_\alpha$ be the associated global Kuranishi chart constructed in \textsection\ref{subsec:construction} and recall that its base space $\cBR$ is a torus bundle over the blow-up of a subset of regular stable maps in some complex projective space. By \textsection\ref{subsec:base-with-levels}, there exists a further generalized blow-up $\cBS\to \cBR$ based on refining decorated trees to decorated trees with levels.
We now use $\alpha$ to construct a `leveled thickening' $\cTR$ and will show that it is homeomorphic to the pullback of $\cT$ along $\cBS \to \cBR$, see Corollary~\ref{cor:map-to-leveled-base}. 

\begin{definition}\label{de:leveled-thickening}
    The \emph{leveled thickening} $\cTR \coloneq \cc{\cT}^\bR(T)$ is given set-wise by the disjoint union 
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:leveled-thickening}
        \cTR \coloneqq \djun{T'_{\ell'}\to T_{\ell}}\modulo{\cTR(T'_{\ell'})}{\Aut(T'_{\ell'}/T_{\ell})}
    \end{equation}
    where $\cTR(T'_{\ell'})$ is the quotient $\cTR(T'_{\ell'}) = \wt\cTR(T'_{\ell'})/\bR^{\max\ell'}$ of the space $\wt\cTR(T'_{\ell'}) = \{(\varphi,u,w)\}$, where 
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=20pt]
        \item $\varphi \in \cBR|_{T'}$,
        \item $u = (u_v)_{v\in V(T'_{\ell'})}$ is a sequence of maps, where 
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=15pt]
            \item for $v \in V_{nt}(T'_{\ell'}) = V(T') $ 
        $$u_v \cl (\dot{\cC}|_{\varphi})_v \to \bR\times Y$$ 
        is a smooth map representing $\beta_v$, which is positively/negatively asymptotic near the puncture $z_{v,e}\in (\cC|_{\varphi})_v$ to the trivial cylinder over $\gamma_e$, while
        \item for $v \in V_t(T'_{\ell'})$, $u_v$ is the trivial cylinder over the associated Reeb orbit;
        \end{itemize}
        \item $w\in V_r$ is a vector so that for any $v \in  V_{nt}(T'_{\ell'}) $ we have 
        \begin{equation}
            \delbar_{J}\, u_v\ + \ \mu_k(w)|_{\graph(\check{\varphi}_v,u_v)} \ = \ 0.
        \end{equation}
    \end{itemize}
    We require that $(\varphi,u,w)$ satisfy the regularity assumption~\eqref{eq:perturbations-suffice} and equip $\cTR$ with the Gromov topology.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    An unbranched trivial cylinder is regular by \cite[Lemma~2.40]{Par19}, so it is not an issue that we do not perturb them.
\end{remark}


\begin{proposition}\label{prop:gluing-level}
Fix a point $(\varphi,u_0,w) \in \cTR$. Let $g\cl   G_{T_\varphi/} \times  \cBR|_{T_\varphi} \times N\hookrightarrow  \cT$ denote the gluing map as constructed in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:gluing-main}. Then, there is a lift $lg$ of the map $g$ to a gluing map for the leveled thickening $\cTR$ such that the following diagram is Cartesian,
\begin{equation}\label{dig:blow-up-square}
\begin{tikzcd}
 {[}0,1)^k\times \cBR|_{T_\varphi}\times \prod_{j = 1}^{\max\ell}(\Delta^{\#\ell\inv(j)-1})^{\text{int}}\times N \arrow[rr,  "lg"] \arrow[d,"\rho"] && U^\bR \arrow[d] \\
 G_{T_\varphi/}\times  \cBR|_{T_\varphi} \times  N\arrow[rr, "g"] && U 
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
where $U^\bR$ and $U$ are neighborhoods of the points $(\varphi,u_0,w)$ and $(\varphi,[u_0],w)$ in $\cTR$ and $\cT$ respectively. 
The vertical arrow on the right is the natural projection map induced by forgetting the level data. The left vertical arrow $p$ is defined by  $$\rho(t,b,x,u,w) = (\varDelta(t,x),b,\cc{u},w),$$
where the map $u\mapsto \cc{u}$ forgets the trivial cylinders in $u$ and quotients by more translations. 
\end{proposition}


\begin{proof}
We first choose the lift $\wt\varphi$ of $\varphi$, using the leveled building $u_0$. The key observation is that a cylindrical chart at a puncture $p_{v,e}$ determines a tangent vector in $T_{p_{v,e}}C_v$. Indeed, a cylindrical chart can be compactified to obtain a disc chart $\vartheta \cl \bD^2_r \to C_v$ so that $\vartheta(0)=p_{v,e}$ and the associated tangent vector is $d\vartheta(0)1 \in T_{p_{v,e}}C_v$. Using these tangent vectors, Lemma~\ref{lem:tangent-vectors-give-lift} gives us a lift $\wt\varphi$ of $\varphi$ in $\cBS$. We will see that the leveled building determines cylindrical charts up to first order and thus a lift. We first fix a representative of $u_0$.
As in \S \ref{ssc:base_gluing}, choose sections $q'_v$ of the smooth locus of the universal family $\cC\to \cBR$ near $\varphi$. This determined a unique representative $\ol{u}_0 \cl \cC^o_\varphi \to \bR \times Y$ by requiring that $\ol{u}_0(q'_v) \in \{0\}\times Y$ for each $v$. We can similarly add marked points $q'_v$ to get a representative $\wt{u}_0$ of the leveled building $u_0$ such that $\wt{u}_0(q'_v) = 0$. Fix cylindrical charts near each puncture $p \in \cC|_\varphi$ such that $u_0$ is given by 
\[u_0(s,t) = (L_\gamma s,\wt\gamma(t)) + O(e^{-ks}) \]
in these local coordinates, where $\wt\gamma$ is a parametrization of $\gamma$ given by the base point (which is non-unique if $\gamma$ is multiply-covered). We call such a chart a \textit{normalizing end} and use them together with the above observation to obtain a lift $\wt \varphi$ of $\varphi$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:tangent-vectors-give-lift}. A direct computation shows that $\wt \varphi$ does not depend on the choice of representative of the leveled building $u_0$ or the sections $q'_v$. Using this lift $\wt \varphi$, we get a local chart $g_b\cl G_{T_\varphi} \times \cBR|_{T_\varphi} \to \cBR$ and its lift $lg_b$ as in \eqref{dig:square-base}.

We first construct $lg$ on $\{0\}^k \times \cBR|_{T_\varphi}\times \prod_{j = 1}^{\max\ell}(\Delta^{\#\ell\inv(j)-1})^{\text{int}}\times N$, we can extend it to the whole space by a similar construction as in Theorem \ref{thm:gluing-main}. 
We define ${lg}$ on $\{0\}^k \times \cBR|_{T_\varphi}\times \prod_{j = 1}^{\max\ell}(\Delta^{\#\ell\inv(j)-1})^{\text{int}}\times N$ as 
$${lg} \cl \{0\}^k \times \cBR|_{T_\varphi}\times \prod_{j = 1}^{\max\ell}(\Delta^{\#\ell\inv(j)-1})^{\text{int}}\times N  \to U^\bR|_{(T_\varphi,\ell)}$$
given by the relation
$${lg}\lbr{lg_b\inv(\wt\varphi), [u],w'} := (\varphi,u,w'),$$ 
where $(\varphi,u,w')$ lies in a small enough neighborhood $U^\bR|_{(T_\varphi,\ell)} \subset  \cTR|_{(T_nu,\ell)} $ in the restriction of $\cTR$ to the strata of leveled tree type $(T_\varphi,\ell).$   

Finally, we extend ${lg}$ to obtain the required lift $lg$ of $g$ as stated in the diagram \eqref{dig:blow-up-square} by a construction similar to that of $\Glue$ in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:gluing-main}. The construction of the diagonal map $\Delta$ ensures that while performing the gluing of the target as in \S \ref{ssc:targ_glu}, we glue cylinders of the same length between two levels. The rest of the gluing construction can be followed verbatim to obtain the leveled gluing map $lg$. 
\end{proof}

We can now prove the key result that will allow us to show that the global Kuranishi chart for $\Mbar^{\, J}(T)$ pulled back along $\cBS\to\cBR$ yields a global Kuranishi for $\Mbar^{\, J}_{\sft}(T_\ell)$. 

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:map-to-leveled-base} There exists a canonical map $\pi^\bR\cl\cTR\to \cBS$ so that the following square 
    \begin{equation}\label{dig:blow-up-square-thickening}
    \begin{tikzcd}
    \cTR \arrow[r,"\Pi"] \arrow[d,"\pi^\bR"] & \cT \arrow[d,"\pi"] \\
    \cBS\arrow[r, ""] & \cBR 
    \end{tikzcd}\end{equation}
is a pullback square. 
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof} 
In order to construct $\pi^\bR$, fix open covers $\{U_i^\bR\}_{i\in I^\bR}$ of $\cTR$ and $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ of $\cT$ with maps $i \mapsto i'$ so that there exist local charts $lg_i$ and $g_{i'}$ as in~\eqref{dig:blow-up-square} and so that we have diffeomorphisms $lg_{b,i}$ and $g_{b,i'}$ onto $V_i^\bR\sub \cBS$ for $i\in I^\bR$ and $V_{i'} \sub \cBR$ for $i'\in I$ as in \eqref{dig:square-base}, with $\pi(U_{i'}) \sub V_{i'}$ for each $i'$. Moreover, choose the $U_i^\bR$ so that 
$$\Pi\inv(U_{i'}) \,=\, \union{i\in I^\bR_{i'}}{U_{i}^\bR}.$$
for each $j \in I$ and, shrinking the sets $V_i^\bR$, that $V_i^\bR\neq V_{j}^\bR$ for $i\neq j$ with $i'\neq j'$.
Increasing the cover $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ trivially, we may assume $I^\bR = I$. Thus, we may define $\pi^\bR_i\cl U_i^\bR\to V_i^\bR$ to be the composition 
\begin{multline}
    U_i^\bR\,\xra{lg_i\inv }\,[0,1)^{k_i}\times \cBR|_{T_i}\times  \prod_{j = 1}^{\max\ell_i}(\Delta^{\#\ell_i\inv(j)-1})^{\text{int}}\times N_i\\\longrightarrow\, [0,1)^{k_i}\times \cBR|_{T_i}\times  \prod_{j = 1}^{\max\ell_i}(\Delta^{\#\ell_i\inv(j)-1})^{\text{int}} \,\xra{lg_{b,i}} V_i^\bR.
\end{multline}
This map makes the square
\begin{equation}\label{dig:blow-up-square-open-subset}
    \begin{tikzcd}
    U_i^\bR \arrow[r,""] \arrow[d,"\pi_i^\bR"] & U_i \arrow[d,"\pi|_{U_i}"] \\
    V_i^\bR\arrow[r, ""] & V_i 
    \end{tikzcd}\end{equation}
    commute due to the commutativity of~\eqref{dig:square-base} and~\eqref{dig:blow-up-square-thickening}. That $U_i^\bR$ is the fiber product can be checked using the local coordinates $lg_i$ and $g_i$ as well as their counterparts on the base, whence it becomes immediate. The universal property of the fiber product implies that $\pi_i^\bR$ agrees with $\pi_j^\bR$ on the intersection $U_i^\bR\cap U_j^\bR$, yielding the map $\pi^\bR$.
    Moreover, it follows from~\eqref{dig:blow-up-square} that
\begin{equation}
    U_i^\bR \,=\, \Pi\inv(U_i) \cap (\pi^\bR)\inv(V_i^\bR).
\end{equation}
    Thus we may conclude by a formal argument, using that the squares~\eqref{dig:blow-up-square-open-subset} are Cartesian.
\end{proof}


\subsubsection{Disconnected buildings}
Let us now here also record the construction of a global Kuranishi chart for moduli spaces of disconnected leveled buildings.  

\begin{definition}\label{de:disconnected-domains}
    Suppose $\Lambda\cl \Gamma^-\to \Gamma^+$ is a function, and let $\beta = (\beta-\gamma)_\gamma\in \Gamma^+$ be a sequence of relative homology classes. We define $\Mbar^{\, J}_{\sft}(\Gamma^+,\Gamma^-;\beta)_\Lambda$ to be the moduli space of leveled buildings with $|\Gamma^+|$ components, where the curve restricted to a connected component is positively asymptotic to a unique Reeb orbit $\gamma\in \Gamma^+$ and negatively asymptotic to the Reeb orbits in $\Lambda_\gamma\coloneqq \Lambda\inv(\gamma)$.
\end{definition}

\noindent The corresponding moduli space $\Mbar^{\,J}(\Gamma^+,\Gamma^-;\beta)_\Lambda$ of Pardon buildings is simply the product 
$$\Mbar^{\,J}(\Gamma^+,\Gamma^-)_\Lambda\coloneqq \p{\gamma\in \Gamma^+}{\Mbar^{\,J}(\gamma,\Lambda_\gamma;\beta_\gamma)}.$$
However, in the case of leveled buildings, we have to incorporate the relative translations between components.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:disconnected-buildings}
   Let $\cK_{\gamma,\Lambda_\gamma}$ be the global Kuranishi chart constructed for $\Mbar^{\,J}(\gamma,\Lambda_\gamma;\beta_\gamma)$ in Theorem~\ref{thm:pardon-gkc} with base space $\cBR_{\gamma,\Lambda_\gamma}$. Then, letting $\cBS_\Lambda$ be the base space constructed in \S\ref{subsec:base-for-disconnected}, the pullback chart  
   $$\cK^\bR_\Lambda \,\coloneqq\, \cBS_\Lambda\times_{\p{\gamma}{\cBR_{\gamma,\Lambda_\gamma}}}\p{\gamma}{\cK_{\gamma,\Lambda_\gamma}}$$ 
   is a global Kuranishi chart with corners for $\Mbar^{\, J}_{\sft}(\Gamma^+,\Gamma^-;\beta)_\Lambda$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    The proof is analogous to the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:leveled-gkc}, using the correspondence between forests and trees with a `ghost vertex' discussed at the beginning of \S\ref{subsec:base-for-disconnected}.
\end{proof}
