	            Math Soc 22:233--286, 2009), we showed that the dg category
	            Shc(X) of constructible sheaves on X quasi-embeds into the
	            triangulated envelope F(T* X) of the Fukaya category of T* X.
	            We prove here that the quasi-embedding is in fact a
	            quasi-equivalence. When X is a complex manifold, one may
	            interpret this as a topological analogue of the

	            modest homological assumptions) are equivalent in the Fukaya

	abstract = {We set up a general theory of weak or homotopy-coherent
	            enrichment in an arbitrary monoidal $\infty$-category. Our
	            theory of enriched $\infty$-categories has many desirable
	            properties; for instance, if the enriching $\infty$-category
	            V is presentably symmetric monoidal then Cat$\infty$V is as
	            well. These features render the theory useful even when an $
	            \infty$-category of enriched $\infty$-categories comes from a
	            model category (as is often the case in examples of interest,
	            e.g. dg-categories, spectral categories, and ($\infty$,
	            n)-categories). This is analogous to the advantages of $
	            \infty$-categories over more rigid models such as simplicial
	            categories — for example, the resulting $\infty$-categories
	            of functors between enriched $\infty$-categories
	            automatically have the correct homotopy type. We construct
	            the homotopy theory of V-enriched $\infty$-categories as a
	            certain full subcategory of the $\infty$-category of
	            “many-object associative algebras” in V. The latter are
	            defined using a non-symmetric version of Lurie's $\infty
	            $-operads, and we develop the basics of this theory, closely
	            following Lurie's treatment of symmetric $\infty$-operads.
	            While we may regard these “many-object” algebras as enriched
	            $\infty$-categories, we show that it is precisely the full
	            subcategory of “complete” objects (in the sense of Rezk, i.e.
	            those whose spaces of objects are equivalent to their spaces
	            of equivalences) that are local with respect to the class of
	            fully faithful and essentially surjective functors. We also
	            consider an alternative model of enriched $\infty$-categories
	            as certain presheaves of spaces satisfying analogues of the
	            “Segal condition” for Rezk's Segal spaces. Lastly, we present
	            some applications of our theory, most notably the
	            identification of associative algebras in V as a coreflective
	            subcategory of pointed V-enriched $\infty$-categories as well
	            as a proof of a strong version of the Baez–Dolan
	            stabilization hypothesis.},
