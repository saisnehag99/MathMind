The Difference Subgroup Graph of a Finite Group,2025-11-06 14:39:19+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04411v1,"The \emph{difference subgroup graph} $D(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is defined
as the graph whose vertices are the non-trivial proper subgroups of $G$, with
two distinct vertices $H$ and $K$ adjacent if and only if $\langle H, K \rangle
= G$ but $HK \ne G$. This graph arises naturally as the difference between the
join graph $\Delta(G)$ and the comaximal subgroup graph $\Gamma(G)$. In this
paper, we initiate a systematic study of $D(G)$ and its reduced version
$D^*(G)$, obtained by removing isolated vertices.
  We establish several fundamental structural properties of these graphs,
including conditions for connectivity, forbidden subgraph characterizations,
and the relationship between graph parameters - such as independence number,
clique number, and girth - and the solvability or nilpotency of the underlying
group.
  The paper concludes with a discussion of open problems and potential
directions for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04411v1,2511.04411v1,GR
Dynamics of Word Maps on Groups and Polynomial Maps on Algebras,2025-11-06 14:01:57+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04377v1,"We introduce the notions of Fatou and Julia sets in the context of word maps
on complex Lie groups and polynomial maps on finite-dimensional associative
$\mathbb C$-algebras. For the group-theoretic question, we investigate the
dynamics of the power map $x \mapsto x^{M}$ on the Lie group
$\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb C)$, where $M \geq 2$ is an integer. For the
algebra-related question, we study polynomial self-maps of
$\mathrm{M}_n(\mathbb C)$ induced by monic one-variable polynomials. In both
cases, we pin down the explicit description of the Fatou and Julia sets. We
also show that there does not exist any wandering Fatou component of the pair
$(p,\mathrm{M}_n(\mathbb C))$ where $p\in\mathbb C[z]$ is a monic polynomial of
degree $\geq 2$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04377v1,2511.04377v1,GR
Character Theory for Semilinear Representations,2025-11-06 11:48:54+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04296v1,"Let $G$ be a group acting on a field $L$, and suppose that $L /K$ is a finite
Galois extension, where $K = L^G$. We show that the irreducible semilinear
representations of $G$ over $L$ can be completely described in terms of
irreducible linear representations of $H$, the kernel of $G \rightarrow
\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$. When $G$ is finite and $|G| \in L^{\times}$ this provides a
character theory for semilinear representations of $G$ over $L$, which recovers
ordinary character theory when the action of $G$ on $L$ is trivial.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04296v1,2511.04296v1,GR
The CLT for lamplighter groups with an acylindrically hyperbolic base,2025-11-06 10:27:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04241v1,"We prove a Central Limit Theorem for the drift of a non-elementary random
walk with a finite exponential moment on a wreath product $A\wr H=\bigoplus_{H}

Automorphism Groups and Structure of 4-Valent Cayley Graphs on Dihedral Groups,2025-11-06 07:56:43+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04151v1,"Let G be a finite group and S be an inverse-closed subset of G not containing
the identity. The Cayley graph Cay(G, S) has vertex set G, where two vertices x
and y are adjacent if and only if the group element obtained by applying the
group operation to x and the inverse of y belongs to S. Kaseasbeh and Erfanian
(2021) determined the structure of all Cayley graphs on the dihedral group of
order 2n for subsets S of size at most three. We extend their work by analyzing
the structure of all such Cayley graphs for subsets S of size four. Among other
results, our main results are as follows for subsets S of size at least four:
(1) using a classical result of Burnside and Schur (1911), we determine the
automorphism groups of a family of Cayley graphs where S contains only
rotations; (2) if S consists only of rotations, then the Cayley graph is the
disjoint union of two isomorphic circulant graphs on n vertices; and (3) if S
is a set of k reflections generating the dihedral group, then the Cayley graph
is bipartite, forming the disjoint union of k perfect matchings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04151v1,2511.04151v1,GR
Dynamics of actions of automorphisms on the space of one-parameter subgroups of a torus and applications,2025-11-06 06:51:31+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04111v1,"For a connected Lie group $G$, we study the dynamics of actions of
automorphisms of $G$ on certain compact invariant subspaces of closed subgroups
of $G$ in terms of distality and expansivity. We show that only the finite
order automorphisms of $G$ act distally on Sub$^p_G$, the smallest compact
space containing all closed one-parameter subgroups of $G$, when $G$ is any
$n$-torus, $n\in\mathbb{N}$. This enables us to relate distality of the
$T$-action on Sub$^p_G$ with that of the $T$-action on $G$ and characterise the
same in terms of compactness of closed subgroups generate by $T$ in the group
Aut$(G)$, in case $G$ is not a vector group. We also extend these results to
the action of subgroups of automorphisms. We show that any $n$-torus $G$,
$n\geq 2$, more generally, any connected Lie group $G$ whose central torus has
dimension at least 2, does not admit any automorphism which acts expansively on
Sub$^p_G$. Our results generalise some results on distal actions by Shah and
Yadav, and by Chatterjee and Shah, and some results on expansive actions by
Prajapati and Shah.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04111v1,2511.04111v1,GR
"On a lemma of Milnor and Schwarz, après Rosendal",2025-11-05 22:28:58+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03887v1,"Perhaps the fundamental theorem of geometric group theory, the
Milnor--Schwarz lemma gives conditions under which the orbit map relating the
geometry of a geodesic metric space and the word metric on a group acting
isometrically on the space is a quasi-isometry.
  Pioneering work of Rosendal makes these and other techniques of geometric
group theory applicable to an arbitrary (topological) group. We give a succinct
treatment of the Milnor--Schwarz lemma, setting it within this context. We
derive some applications of this theory to non-Archimedean groups, which have
plentiful continuous actions on graphs. In particular, we sharpen results of
BarNatan and Verberne on actions of ""big"" mapping class groups on hyperbolic
graphs and clarify a project begun by Mann and Rafi to classify these mapping
class groups up to quasi-isometry, noting some extensions to the theory of
mapping class groups of locally finite infinite graphs and homeomorphism groups
of Stone spaces.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03887v1,2511.03887v1,GR
A note on co-Hopfian groups and rings,2025-11-05 14:37:33+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03505v1,"Let $p$ and $n$ be positive integers. Assume additionally that $p\neq 3$ is a
prime and that $n>2$. Let $R$ be a field of characteristic $p$. A very special
consequence of a result of Bunina and Kunyavskii (2023, arXiv:2308.10076) is
that $SL_{n}(R)$ is co-Hopfian as a group if and only if $R$ is co-Hopfian as a
ring. In this paper, we prove that if $k$ is the algebraic closure of the $2$
element field, then $SL_{2}(k)$ is a co-Hopfian group. Since this $k$ is
trivially seen to be co-Hopfian as a ring our result somewhat extends that of
Bunina and Kunyavskii. We apply our result to prove that the class of groups
satisfying Turner's Retract Theorem (called Turner groups here) is not closed
under elementary equivalence thereby answering a question posed by the authors
in (2017, Comm. Algebra).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03505v1,2511.03505v1,GR
On metacyclic p-group codes,2025-11-05 12:47:52+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03429v1,"In this article, we study the metacyclic p-group codes arising from finite
semisimple group algebras. In [CM25], we studied group codes arising from
metacyclic groups with order divisible by two distinct odd primes. In the
current work, we focus on metacyclic p-group codes, as a result of which we are
also able to extend the results of [CM25] for metacyclic groups with order
divisible by any two primes, not necessarily odd or distinct. Consequently,
existing results on group algebras of some important classes of groups,
including dihedral and quaternion groups, have been extended. Additionally, we
provide left codes for the undertaken group algebras. Finally, we construct
non-central codes using units motivated by Bass and bicyclic units, which are
inequivalent to any abelian group codes and yield best known parameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03429v1,2511.03429v1,GR
"A partial order on the 240 packings of PG(3,2)",2025-11-04 22:29:58+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03040v1,"It has long been known that the most symmetrical solutions of Kirkman's
Schoolgirl Problem can be constructed from the $240$ packings of the projective
space $PG(3, 2)$, but it seems to have escaped notice that these packings have
the structure of a partially ordered set. In this paper, we construct a
shellable Bruhat-like graded partial order on the packings of $PG(3, 2)$ that
refines the partial order on the product of four chains
$[8]\times[5]\times[3]\times[2]$ and defines a Lehmer code on the packings. The
partial order exists because the packings of $PG(3, 2)$ form a quasiparabolic
set (in the sense of Rains--Vazirani) that is in bijective correspondence with
a certain collection of maximal orthogonal subsets of the $E_8$ root system.
The $E_8$ construction also induces transitive actions of the Weyl groups of
type $D_n$ on the packings for $5 \leq n \leq 8$, and these actions are
faithful for $n < 8$. It is possible to define both the signed permutation
action and the partial order using the combinatorics of labelled Fano planes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03040v1,2511.03040v1,GR

semigroup constructions: the zero-union and the direct product. For both

chromatic number and knit degree of their commuting graphs and, when possible,
we exhibit the relationship between each one of these properties and the
corresponding properties of the commuting graphs of the original semigroups.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03003v1,2511.03003v1,GR
A Hurewicz-type theorem for quasimorphisms of countable approximate groups,2025-11-04 12:16:41+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02522v1,"In their theorem from 2006, A. Dranishnikov and J. Smith prove that if
$f:G\to H$ is a group homomorphism, then the following formula for asymptotic
dimension is true: $\operatorname{asdim} G \leq \operatorname{asdim} H +
\operatorname{asdim} (\ker f)$. This result is known as the Hurewicz-type
formula, after a 1927 theorem from classical dimension theory by W. Hurewicz,
which inspired it. In this paper we establish a similar formula to the one by
Dranishnikov and Smith, for the following setup: whenever $(\Xi, \Xi^\infty)$
and $(\Lambda,\Lambda^\infty)$ are countable approximate groups and $f:(\Xi,
\Xi^\infty) \to (\Lambda,\Lambda^\infty)$ is a (general) quasimorphism, i.e., a
quasimorphism which need not be symmetric nor unital, then the following
formula is true: $$\operatorname{asdim} \Xi \leq \operatorname{asdim} \Lambda +
\operatorname{asdim} \left(f^{-1}\left(f(e_\Xi)D(f)^{-1}D(f)\right)\right),$$
where $D(f)$ is the defect set of $f$. It follows as a corollary that if
$f:G\to H$ is a quasimorphism of countable groups, then $\operatorname{asdim}
G\leq \operatorname{asdim} H + \operatorname{asdim}
\left(f^{-1}\left(f(e_\Xi)D(f)^{-1}D(f)\right)\right)$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02522v1,2511.02522v1,GR

Every group is represented by an incidence geometry,2025-11-04 09:40:30+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02410v1,"We investigate the relationship between finite groups and incidence
geometries through their automorphism structures. Building upon classical
results on the realizability of groups as automorphism groups of graphs, we
develop a general framework to represent pairs of finite groups $(G, H)$, where
$H \trianglelefteq G$, as pairs of correlation--automorphism groups of suitable
incidence geometries. Specifically, we prove that for every such pair $(G, H)$,
there exists an incidence geometry $\Gamma$ satisfying that the pair
$(\operatorname{Aut}(\Gamma), \operatorname{Aut}_I(\Gamma))$ of
correlation--automorphism groups of $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to $(G, H)$. Our
construction proceeds in two main steps: first, we realize $(G, H)$ as the
correlation and automorphism groups of an incidence system; then, we refine
this system into a genuine incidence geometry preserving the same pair of
groups. We also provide explicit examples, including a family of geometries
realizing $(S_n, A_n)$ for all $n \ge 2$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02410v1,2511.02410v1,GR
Jensen's Functional Equation on Involution-Generated Groups: An ($\mathrm{SR}_2$) Criterion and Applications,2025-11-04 02:18:07+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02870v1,"We study the Jensen functional equations on a group $G$ with values in an
abelian group $H$: \begin{align} \tag{J1}\label{eq:J1}

f(xy)+f(x^{-1}y)&=2f(y)\qquad(\forall\,x,y\in G), \end{align} with the
normalization $f(e)=0.$ Building on techniques for the symmetric groups $S_n$,
we isolate a structural criterion on $G$ -- phrased purely in terms of
involutions and square roots -- under which every solution to \eqref{eq:J1}
must also satisfy \eqref{eq:J2} and is automatically a group homomorphism. Our
new criterion, denoted $(\mathrm{SR}_2)$, implies that $S_1(G,H) = S_{1,2}(G,H)
= \mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$, applies to many reflection-generated groups and, in
particular, recovers the full solution on $S_n.$ Furthermore, we give a
transparent description of the solution space in terms of the abelianization
$G/[G,G],$ and we treat dihedral groups $D_m$ in detail, separating the cases
$m$ odd and even. The approach is independent of division by 2 in $H$ and
complements the classical complex-valued theory that reduces \eqref{eq:J1} to
functions on $G/[G,[G,G]].$",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02870v1,2511.02870v1,GR

"Percolation on graphs of polynomial growth is local: analyticity, supercritical sharpness, isoperimetry",2025-11-03 18:57:25+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01851v1,"We investigate locality of the supercritical regime for Bernoulli percolation

Take a transitive graph of polynomial growth $\mathscr{G}$ satisfying

another such graph and assume that $\mathscr{G}$ and $\mathscr{H}$ have the
same ball of radius $r$ for $r$ large. We prove that various quantities
regarding percolation of parameter close to $p$ on $\mathscr{H}$ can be well
understood from $(\mathscr{G},p)$ alone.
  This includes uniform versions of supercritical sharpness as well as the
Kesten-Zhang bound on the probability of observing a large finite cluster: the
constants involved can be chosen to depend only on $(\mathscr{G},p)$. We also
prove that $\theta_\mathscr{H}$ is an analytic function of $p$ in the whole
supercritical regime and that, for a suitable
$\varepsilon=\varepsilon(\mathscr{G},p)>0$, the analytic extension of
$\theta_\mathscr{H}$ to the $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $p$ in $\mathbb C$
is, uniformly, well approximated by the analytic extension of
$\theta_\mathscr{G}$. The proof relies on new results on the connectivity of
minimal cutsets; in particular, we answer a question asked by Babson and

The N-prime graph and the Subgroup Isomorphism Problem,2025-11-03 18:15:54+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01809v1,"We introduce a directed graph related to a group $G$, which we call the
N-prime graph $\Gamma_{\rm{N}}(G)$ of $G$ and which is a refinement of the
classical Gruenberg-Kegel graph. The vertices of $\Gamma_{\rm{N}}(G)$ are the
primes $p$ such that $G$ has an element of order $p$, and, for distinct
vertices $p$ and $q$, the arc $q\rightarrow p$ is in the graph if and only if
$G$ has a subgroup of order $p$ whose normalizer in $G$ has an element of order
$q$. Generalizing some known results about the Gruenberg-Kegel graph, we prove
that the group $V(\mathbb{Z} G)$ of the units with augmentation $1$ in the
integral group ring $\mathbb{Z} G$ has the same N-prime graph as $G$ if $G$ is
a finite solvable group, and we reduce to almost simple groups the problem of
whether $\Gamma_{\rm{N}}(V(\mathbb{Z} G))=\Gamma_{\rm{N}}(G)$ holds for any
finite group $G$. We also prove that $\Gamma_{\rm{N}}(V(\mathbb{Z}
G))=\Gamma_{\rm{N}}(G)$ if $G$ is almost simple with socle either an
alternating group, or ${\rm{PSL}}(r^f)$ with $r$ prime and $f\le 2$. Finally,
for $G$ solvable we obtain some stronger results which give a contribution to
the Subgroup Isomorphism Problem. More precisely, we prove that if
