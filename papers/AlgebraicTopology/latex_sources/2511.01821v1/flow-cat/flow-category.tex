\section{A contact flow category and bimodules}\label{sec:sft-flow}

In this section we associate a flow category to a contact manifold $(Y,\lambda)$ and a flow bimodule to an exact symplectic cobordism $(X,\omega)$. The objects are finite sequences of Reeb orbits in either case, and morphisms are buildings of genus zero. Due to a technical obstruction, we can only construct the flow category and bimodule after restricting the action of the Reeb orbits. Thus, in \textsection\ref{subsec:colimit-proof}, we show that the ``full'' contact flow category can be obtained via a colimit.
