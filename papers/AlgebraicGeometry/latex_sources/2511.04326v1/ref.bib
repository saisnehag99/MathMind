    abstract = { A general type of fluctuation-dissipation theorem is discussed to show that the physical quantities such as complex susceptibility of magnetic or electric polarization and complex conductivity for electric conduction are rigorously expressed in terms of time-fluctuation of dynamical variables associated with such irreversible processes. This is a generalization of statistical mechanics which affords exact formulation as the basis of calculation of such irreversible quantities from atomistic theory. The general formalism of this statistical-mechanical theory is examined in detail. The response, relaxation, and correlation functions are defined in quantummechanical way and their relations are investigated. The formalism is illustrated by simple examples of magnetic and conduction problems. Certain sum rules are discussed for these examples. Finally it is pointed out that this theory may be looked as a generalization of the Einstein relation. }

 abstract = {We use the method of interlacing polynomials introduced in our previous article to prove two theorems known to imply a positive solution to the Kadison–Singer problem. The first is Weaver's conjecture KS2, which is known to imply Kadison–Singer via a projection paving conjecture of Akemann and Anderson. The second is a formulation due to Casazza et al. of Anderson's original paving conjecture(s), for which we are able to compute explicit paving bounds. The proof involves an analysis of the largest roots of a family of polynomials that we call the "mixed characteristic polynomials" of a collection of matrices.},

 abstract = {In the first three sections the question of when a pure state $g$ on a $C^\ast$-subalgebra $B$ of a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$ has a unique state extension is studied. It is shown that an extension $f$ is unique if and only if $\|\inf\|b(a - f(a)1)b\| = 0$ for each $a$ in $A$, where the $\inf$ is taken over those $b$ in $B$ such that $0 \leqslant b \leqslant 1$ and $g(b) = 1$. The special cases where $B$ is maximal abelian and/or $A = B(H)$ are treated in more detail. In the remaining sections states of the form $T \mapsto \lim_{\mathscr{u}}(Tx_\alpha, x_\alpha)$, where $\{x_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \kappa}$ is a set of unit vectors in $H$ and $\mathscr{U}$ is an ultrafilter are studied.},

abstract = {It is suggested that the fermion determinant for a vector-like gauge theory with strictly massless quarks can be represented on the lattice as det1+V2, where V=X(X†X)−1/2 and X is the Wilson-Dirac lattice operator with a negative mass term. There is no undesired doubling and no need for any fine tuning. Several other appealing features of the formula are pointed out.}

abstract = {An intuitive topological proof is given of the no-go theorem for putting Weyl fermions in weak interaction on a lattice, or for constructing chiral invariant lattice QCD, which was proved by a homotopy theory argument in our preceding paper (Absence I). This theorem hangs on the existence of the charge (e.g. fermion number), and thus on the complex-field formulation and on locality. If we relax the assumptions for the no-go theorem, for instance the existence of the charge, and thus use the real-field formulation, we can construct a model that has only one two-component field. We can assign this model an only approximately conserved charge.}

This allows a purely algebraic formulation of the theory. The framework of an algebraic version of quantum field theory is discussed and compared to the customary operator approach. It is pointed out that one reason (and possibly the only one) for the existence of unitarily inequivalent faithful, irreducible representations in quantum field theory is the (physically irrelevant) behavior of the states with respect to observations made infinitely far away. The separation between such ``global'' features and the local ones is studied. An application of this point of view to superselection rules shows that, for example, in electrodynamics the Hilbert space of states with charge zero carries already all the relevant physical information.}",

abstract = {It is shown, by a homotopy theory argument, that for a general class of fermion theories on a Kogut-Susskind lattice an equal number of species (types) of left- and right-handed Weyl particles (neutrinos) necessarily appears in the continuum limit. We thus present a no-go theorem for putting theories of the weak interaction on a lattice. One of the most important consequences of our no-go theorem is that is not possible, in strong interaction models, to solve the notorious species doubling problem of Dirac fermions on a lattice in a chirally invariant way.}
