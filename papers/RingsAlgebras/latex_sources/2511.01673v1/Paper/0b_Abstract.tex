%Abstract

We completely classify winning strategies in the Ideal Chomp Game played on $\bar{K}$-algebras $R$ of rank at most 6. In this two-player combinatorial game, players 
alternately add generators to build an ideal inside a given ring $R$, with the player who builds an ideal equal to the entire ring losing. We prove that player A has a winning strategy on all $\bar{K}$-algebras $R$ up to rank 6 except for five specific cases: $\bar{K}$ itself, $\bar{K}[x,y]/(x,y)^2$, and three other local algebras. Our methods combine game-theoretic analysis with the structure theory of Artinian rings and computational verification. We also discuss a classical result of Henson on winning strategies in the Ideal Chomp Game, as well as ideas and open questions about the Ideal Chomp Game on higher-dimensional $\bar{K}$-algebras.
