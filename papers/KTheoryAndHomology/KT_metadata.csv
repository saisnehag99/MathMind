The real cycle class isomorphism for linear schemes,2025-11-04 12:59:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02549v1,"The real cycle class map $H^i(X,\underline{I}^j(\mathcal{L})) \rightarrow
H^i_\text{sing}(X(\mathbb{R}),\mathbb{Z}(\mathcal{L}))$ is an isomorphism for
$j\geq \dim(X)+1$ for any scheme $X$ over $\mathbb{R}$ by a result of Jacobson.
It is also known to be an isomorphism for $j\geq i$, the earliest possible
case, if $X$ is cellular due to Hornbostel-Wendt-Xie-Zibrowius. This paper
generalizes their result to linear schemes, providing (precise) intermediate
bounds on the range, where the real cycle class map is an isomorphism.
Moreover, we show that Lerbet's conjectured upper bound for the exponent of the
cokernel of $H^i(X,\underline{I}^i(\mathcal{L})) \rightarrow
H^i_\text{sing}(X(\mathbb{R}),\mathbb{Z}(\mathcal{L}))$ cannot be improved.

A computation of $THH_*(ku)$ using a gathered spectral sequence,2025-11-04 08:11:02+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02346v1,"In this article, we extend the computation of topological Hochschild homology
(THH) of the Adams summand $\ell$ of $p$-localized connective complex
topological K-theory ($ku$) to THH of $ku$ itself. We leverage the relation
$u^{p-1} = v_1$, where $u$ is a generator of $ku_*$ and $v_1$ is a generator of
$\ell_*$, and we consider the cofiber of the multiplication by $v_1$ in $ku$,
denoted $ku/v_1$. We use the morphism between the Bockstein spectral sequence
of the multiplication by $v_1$ computing $THH_*(\ell)$ and $THH_*(ku)$; we
develop a general technique using what we term a gathered spectral sequence
that allows us to explore the relationship between the Bockstein spectral
sequence for the multiplications by $v_1$ and $u$, yielding a computation of
$THH_*(ku)$. Our method is not only applicable to this specific problem but
also potentially useful in other computations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02346v1,2511.02346v1,KT
Revisiting the $β_1$-action on the $3$-primary stable homotopy groups of spheres,2025-11-04 07:21:10+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02324v1,"Let $\beta_1$ be the first $3$-torsion class in the stable homotopy groups of
spheres in even degree. Toda showed that $\beta_1^5 \neq 0$, whilst $\beta_1^6
= 0$. Shimomura generalised this to the $144$-periodic family generated by
$\beta_1$, written as $\{\beta_{1+9s}\}_{s\geq 0}$, and showed that any
$5$-fold product $\prod_5 \beta_{1+9s} \neq 0$, whilst all $6$-fold products
$\prod_6 \beta_{1+9s} = 0$. In this article, we give a simple proof of these
results as well as some generalisations to other $144$-periodic families. Our
tools include BP-synthetic spectra, and the well-known Adams--Novikov spectral
sequence for the spectrum of topological modular forms at the prime $3$ as well
as its Adams operations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02324v1,2511.02324v1,KT
Motivic multiplicativity of complete intersections,2025-11-03 09:08:38+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01362v1,"For a smooth projective variety equipped with a Chow-K\""unneth (abbr. CK)
decomposition, the notions of motivic multiple twist-multiplicativity and
multiplicativity defect are introduced to interpret the obstruction to the
compatibility of the multiple intersection product with its CK decompositions,
generalizing the more restrictive notion of multiplicativity introduced in
[31]. We establish the basic properties of these notions. Then we show that the
multiplicativity defects of curves, surfaces and ample subvarieties in
varieties with trivial Chow groups have reasonable upper bounds. Furthermore,
we determine explicitly the motivic 2-fold multiplicativity defect for any Fano
or Calabi-Yau complete intersection in a smooth weighted projective space,
strengthening a main result of [11] in the Calabi-Yau case. Particularly, any
Fano or Calabi-Yau hypersurface admits motivic 0-multiplicativity, generalizing
the case of cubic hypersurfaces proved in [10] and [13], and conforming a
conjecture of Voisin [35] in the Calabi-Yau case. As a consequence, certain
relative powers of the corresponding universal families satisfy the Franchetta
property. We also provide several other applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01362v1,2511.01362v1,KT
On equivariant embeddings of G-bundles,2025-11-01 23:06:51+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00734v1,"For a compact group G, we give a sufficient condition for embedding one
G-equivariant vector bundle into another one and for a stable isomorphism
between two such bundles to imply an isomorphism. Our criteria involve
multiplicities of irreducible representations of stabiliser groups. We also
apply our result to ordinary nonequivariant vector bundles over the fields of
quaternions, real and complex numbers and to ``real'' and ``quaternionic''
vector bundles. Our results apply to the classification of symmetry-protected
topological phases of matter, providing computable bounds on the number of
energy bands required to distinguish robust from fragile topological phases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00734v1,2511.00734v1,KT
Topological insulators and stable isomorphism versus isomorphism of vector bundles,2025-11-01 20:25:31+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00695v1,"This note gives an overview of the mathematical framework underlying
topological insulators, highlighting the connection to K-theory and vector
bundles. We see ``real'' and ``quaternionic'' vector bundles arise naturally in
the presence of time-reversal symmetry. Our recent results about when stable
isomorphism implies isomorphism are summarised, including some ongoing work for
G-equivariant K-theory for finite groups. This clarifies when K-theory
completely distinguishes topological phases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00695v1,2511.00695v1,KT
Affineness and reconstruction in complex-periodic geometry,2025-10-30 17:12:53+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26711v1,"Working in a generic derived algebro-geometric context, we lay the
foundations for the general study of affineness and local descendability. When
applied to $\mathbf{E}_\infty$ rings equipped with the fpqc topology, these
foundations give an $\infty$-category of spectral stacks, a viable
functor-of-points alternative to Lurie's approach to nonconnective spectral
algebraic geometry. Specializing further to spectral stacks over the moduli
stack of oriented formal groups, we use chromatic homotopy theory to obtain a
large class of $0$-affine stacks, generalizing Mathew--Meier's famous
$0$-affineness result. We introduce a spectral refinement of Hopkins' stack
construction of an $\mathbf{E}_\infty$ ring, and study when it provides an
inverse to the global sections of a spectral stack. We use this to show that a
large class of stacks, which we call reconstructible, are naturally determined
by their global sections, including moduli stacks of oriented formal groups of
bounded height and the moduli stack of oriented elliptic curves.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26711v1,2510.26711v1,KT
Homological dimensions of algebras of analytic functionals and their completions,2025-10-30 08:33:57+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26249v1,"We show that the main homological dimensions of the algebra of analytic
functionals on a connected complex Lie group, as well as some of its
completions, coincide with the dimension of the simply connected solvable
factor in the canonical decomposition of the linearization of this group. Thus,
the possible nontriviality of a linearly complex reductive factor does not
affect the homological properties of the algebras under consideration.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26249v1,2510.26249v1,KT
Derived induction theory for the K-theory of modular group algebras,2025-10-29 17:56:44+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25763v1,"We prove an induction theorem for the higher algebraic K-groups of group
algebras $kG$ of finite groups $G$ over characteristic $p$ finite fields $k$.
For a certain class of finite groups, which we call $p$-isolated, this reduces
calculations to calculations for their $p$-subgroups. We do so by showing that
the stable module categories of $kH$ as $H$ ranges over subgroups of $G$
assemble into a categorical Green functor, which results in a spectral Green
functor structure on K-theory. By general induction theory, this reduces
proving a spectrum-level induction statement to proving an induction statement
on $\pi_0$ Green functors, which we accomplish using modular representation
theory. For $p$-isolated groups with Sylow $p$-subgroups of order $p$, we
produce explicit new calculations of K-groups.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25763v1,2510.25763v1,KT
Segal models for equivariant incomplete infinite loop spaces,2025-10-28 11:00:51+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24298v1,"We model equivariant infinite loop spaces indexed on incomplete universes via
suitable equivariant analogs of $\Gamma$-spaces. The choice of universe
dictates a transfer system which in turn dictates the Segal condition on
equivariant $\Gamma$-spaces. Equivariant $\Gamma$-spaces themselves come in
different but equivalent guises interpolating between categories $\Gamma$ as
defined by Segal and $\Gamma_G$ as defined by Shimakawa. The main application
is the construction of Segal $K$-theory of normed permutative categories.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24298v1,2510.24298v1,KT

Rationality of cycles modulo 2 on products of generically smooth quadrics in characteristic 2,2025-10-26 02:45:59+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22502v1,"A 2022 result of Karpenko establishes a conjecture of Hoffmann-Totaro on the
possible values of the first higher isotropy index of an arbitrary anisotropic
quadratic form of given dimension over an arbitrary field. For nondegenerate
forms, this essentially goes back to a 2003 article of the same author on
quadratic forms over fields of characteristic not $2$. To handle the more
involved case of degenerate forms in characteristic $2$, Karpenko showed that
certain aspects of the algebraic-geometric approach to nondegenerate quadratic
forms developed by Karpenko, Merkurjev, Rost, Vishik and others can be adapted
to a study of rational cycles modulo $2$ on powers of a given generically
smooth quadric. In this paper, we extend this to a broader study of rational
cycles modulo $2$ on arbitrary products of generically smooth quadrics in
characteristic $2$. A basic objective is to have tools available to study
correspondences between general quadrics, in particular, between smooth and
non-smooth quadrics. Applications of the theory to the study of degenerate
quadratic forms in characteristic $2$ are provided, and a number of open
problems on forms of this type are also formulated and discussed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22502v1,2510.22502v1,KT
$K_1(Var)$ is presented by stratified birational equivalences,2025-10-23 11:10:49+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20433v1,"This paper provides a complete presentation of $K_1(Var)$, the $K_1$ group of
varieties, resolving and simplifying a problem left open in \cite{ZakhK1}. Our
approach adapts Gillet-Grayson's $G$-Construction to define an un-delooped
$K$-theory spectrum of varieties. There are two levels on which one can read
the present paper. On a technical level, we streamline and extend previous
results on the $K$-theory of exact categories to a broader class of categories,
including $Var$. On a more conceptual level, our investigations bring into
focus an interesting generalisation of automorphisms (``double exact squares'')
which generate $K_1$. For varieties, this isolates a subclass of birational
equivalences which we call stratified, but the construction extends to a wide
range of non-additive contexts (e.g. $o$-minimal structures, definable sets
etc.). This raises a challenging question: what kind of information do these
generalised automorphisms calibrate?",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20433v1,2510.20433v1,KT
Eventually periodic resolutions with applications to integral group rings,2025-10-21 15:56:24+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18748v3,"We present a general construction of eventually periodic projective
resolutions for modules over quotients of rings of finite left global dimension

combined with the iterated mapping cone technique, to systematically 'purge'

integral group rings of groups with finite virtual cohomological dimension. We
demonstrate the computability of our method through explicit calculations for

Rigidity of the category of localizing motives,2025-10-19 21:19:30+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17010v1,"In this paper we study the category of localizing motives
$\operatorname{Mot}^{\operatorname{loc}}$ -- the target of the universal
finitary localizing invariant of idempotent-complete stable categories as
defined by Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada. We prove that this (presentable stable)
category is rigid symmetric monoidal in the sense of Gaitsgory and Rozenblyum.
In particular, it is dualizable. More precisely, we prove a more general
version of this result for the category
$\operatorname{Mot}^{\operatorname{loc}}_{\mathcal{E}}$ -- the target of the
universal finitary localizing invariant of dualizable modules over a rigid
symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{E}.$
  We obtain general results on morphisms and internal $\operatorname{Hom}$ in
the categories $\operatorname{Mot}^{\operatorname{loc}}_{\mathcal{E}}$ of
localizing motives. As an application we compute the morphisms in multiple
non-trivial examples. In particular, we prove the corepresentability statements
for $\operatorname{TR}$ (topological restriction) and $\operatorname{TC}$
(topological cyclic homology) when restricted to connective
$\mathbb{E}_1$-rings. As a corollary, for a connective
$\mathbb{E}_{\infty}$-ring $R$ we obtain a $\operatorname{TR}(R)$-module
structure on the nil $K$-theory spectrum $NK(R).$
  We also apply the rigidity theorem to define refined versions of negative
cyclic homology and periodic cyclic homology. This was announced previously in
\cite{E24b}, and certain very interesting examples were computed by Meyer and
Wagner in \cite{MW24}. Here we do several computations in characteristic $0,$
in particular showing that in seemingly innocuous situations the answer can be
given by an interesting algebra of overconvergent functions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17010v1,2510.17010v1,KT

conceivable determinant functor is unique up to rescaling by at worst rational
values. As a result, no transcendental real nor p-adic regulators could ever
show up in special L-value conjectures (as in Tamagawa number conjectures or
