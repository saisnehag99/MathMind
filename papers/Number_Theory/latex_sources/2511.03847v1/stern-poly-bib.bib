  abstract = {We answer a question of Calkin and Wilf concerning the maximal order of Stern's diatomic sequence. Specifically, we prove that \$\${\textbackslash}limsup\_\{n{\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}infty\}{\textbackslash}frac\{a(n)\}\{{\textbackslash}varphi{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}log\_2 n\}\}={\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}varphi{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}log\_2 3\}\}\{{\textbackslash}sqrt\{5\}\},\$\$ where \${\textbackslash}varphi=({\textbackslash}sqrt\{5\}+1)/2\$ is the golden ratio. This improves on previous results given by Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy, who showed that the limit value was bounded above by 1.25, and by Calkin and Wilf, who showed that the exact value was in the interval \$[(\{{\textbackslash}varphi\}/\{{\textbackslash}sqrt\{5\}\})(\{3\}/\{2\}){\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}log\_2{\textbackslash}varphi\},({\textbackslash}varphi+1)/\{{\textbackslash}sqrt\{5\}\}].\$},

@article{Northshield2010,
   abstract = {Stem's diatomic sequence appeared in print in 1858 and has been the subject of numerous papers since. Our goal is to present many of these properties, both old and new. We present a large set of references and, for many properties, we supply simple proofs or ones that complement existing proofs. Among the topics covered are what these numbers count (hyperbinary representations) and the sequence's surprising parallels with the Fibonacci numbers. Quotients of consecutive terms lead to an enumeration of the rationals. Other quotients lead to a map from dyadic rationals to the rationals whose completion is the inverse of Minkowski's? function. Along the way, we get a distant view of fractals and the Riemann hypothesis as well as a foray into random walks on graphs in the hyperbolic plane.},

Khinchin offers a superb introduction to the positive-integral elements of the theory of continued functions, a special algorithm that is one of the most important tools in analysis, probability theory, mechanics, and, especially, number theory.Presented in a clear, straightforward manner, the book comprises three major chapters: the properties of the apparatus, the representation of numbers by continued fractions and the measure theory of continued fractions. The last chapter is somewhat more advanced and deals with the metric, or probability, theory of continued fractions, an important field developed almost entirely by Soviet mathematicians, including Khinchin.The present volume reprints an English translation of the third Russian edition published in 1961. It is not only an excellent introduction to the study of continued fractions, but a stimulating consideration of the profound and interesting problems of the measure theory of numbers.},
