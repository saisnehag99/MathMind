"Embedding Calculus, Goodwillie Calculus and Link Invariants",2025-11-06 17:37:14+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04582v1,"We study Goodwillie-Weiss embedding calculus through its relationship with
Goodwillie's functor calculus. Specifically, building on a result of Tillmann
and Weiss, we construct a functorial complement for \(T_{n}\)-embeddings that
takes values in Heuts's categorical \(n\)-excisive approximation of pointed
spaces. We also establish an analogue of Stallings' theorem for lower central
series in the context of \(T_{n}\)-embeddings of \(P \times I\) into \(D^{d}\)
for any compact manifold \(P\). As an application, we show that the embedding
tower of string links detects Milnor invariants.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04582v1,2511.04582v1,GT
On the Vietoris-Rips Complexes of Integer Lattices,2025-11-06 10:23:45+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04238v1,"For a metric space $X$ and $r \geq 0$, the Vietoris-Rips complex
$\mathcal{VR}(X;r)$ is a simplicial complex whose simplices are finite subsets
of $X$ with diameter at most $r$. Vietoris-Rips complexes have applications in
various places, including data analysis, geometric group theory, sensor
networks, etc. Consider the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ as a metric space
equipped with the $d_1$-metric (the Manhattan metric or standard word metric in
the Cayley graph). Ziga Virk proved that if either $r \geq n^2(2n-1)$, or
$1\leq n \leq 3$ and $r \geq n$, then the complex
$\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible, and posed a question if
$\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible for all $r \geq n$. Recently,
Matthew Zaremsky improved Ziga's result and proved that
$\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible if $r \geq n^2+ n-1$. Further,
he conjectured that $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible for all $r
\geq n$. We prove Zaremsky's conjecture for $n \leq 5$, i.e., we prove that
$\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible if $n \leq 5$ and $r \geq n$.
Further, we prove that $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible for $r
\geq 10$.
  We determine the homotopy type of $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;2)$, and show
that these complexes are homotopy equivalent to a wedge of countably infinite
copies of $\mathbb{S}^3$. We also show that $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is
simply connected for $r \geq 2$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04238v1,2511.04238v1,GT
"On a lemma of Milnor and Schwarz, après Rosendal",2025-11-05 22:28:58+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03887v1,"Perhaps the fundamental theorem of geometric group theory, the
Milnor--Schwarz lemma gives conditions under which the orbit map relating the
geometry of a geodesic metric space and the word metric on a group acting
isometrically on the space is a quasi-isometry.
  Pioneering work of Rosendal makes these and other techniques of geometric
group theory applicable to an arbitrary (topological) group. We give a succinct
treatment of the Milnor--Schwarz lemma, setting it within this context. We
derive some applications of this theory to non-Archimedean groups, which have
plentiful continuous actions on graphs. In particular, we sharpen results of
BarNatan and Verberne on actions of ""big"" mapping class groups on hyperbolic
graphs and clarify a project begun by Mann and Rafi to classify these mapping
class groups up to quasi-isometry, noting some extensions to the theory of
mapping class groups of locally finite infinite graphs and homeomorphism groups
of Stone spaces.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03887v1,2511.03887v1,GT
Triple linking and rational homology cobordism,2025-11-05 19:34:59+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03818v1,"If a rational homology 3-sphere $M$ bounds a rational homology 4-ball $W$,

H_1(W;\mathbb{Z})$ is a Lagrangian for the $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$-valued
torsion linking form $\lambda_2$ on $H_1(M;\mathbb{Z})$. In this short paper,
we prove that the Freedman-Krushkal triple torsion linking form $\lambda_3$
(arXiv:2506.11941v3) vanishes on this Lagrangian under the assumption that
$H_2(W;\mathbb{Z})=0$. We then pose several questions about topological

A note on codimension $2$ spun embedding,2025-11-05 19:25:19+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03812v1,"We prove that if a closed manifold $B$ is a connected component of the
binding of an open book decomposition of a manifold $M$, then every open book
decomposition of $B$ spun embeds in $M$. As an application, we prove that every
open book decomposition of a simply connected spin $5$-manifold spun embeds in

Arithmetic invariants of torus links,2025-11-05 13:07:13+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03446v1,"The classical analogy between knots and primes motivates the study of
Alexander polynomials through an arithmetic perspective. In this article we
study the two-parameter family of torus knots and links $T_{p,q}$ and analyze
the asymptotic behaviour of the zeros of their Alexander polynomials
$\Delta_{p,q}(t)$, defined with respect to the total linking number covering.
We prove that as $p,q\to\infty$ these zeros become equidistributed on the unit
circle and derive an explicit formula for the limiting frequency with which
primitive $r$-th roots of unity appear. To capture finer statistical
information, we introduce the moment sequence of the zero distribution and
compute its generating function in closed form. We further examine the Iwasawa
theory of the corresponding branched covers, determining the Iwasawa
invariants. The logarithmic Mahler measure of $\Delta_{p,q}(t)$ vanishes
identically and the associated homological growth in towers of abelian covers
of $S^3$ branched along $T_{p,q}$ is subexponential.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03446v1,2511.03446v1,GT

A condition on the Khovanov homology of three families of positive links,2025-11-03 23:46:15+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02129v1,"In previous work, we developed diagram-independent upper bounds on the
maximum degree of the Jones polynomial of three families of positive links.
These families are characterized by the second coefficient of the Jones
polynomial. In this paper, we extend those results and construct
diagram-independent upper bounds on the maximum non-vanishing quantum degree of
the Khovanov homology of three families of positive links. This can be used as
a positivity obstruction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02129v1,2511.02129v1,GT
Families of Arcs in 4-Manifolds and Maps of Configuration Spaces,2025-11-03 22:50:07+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02111v1,"In this thesis we construct 3-parameter families $G(p,q,r)$ of embedded arcs
with fixed boundary in a 4-manifold. We then analyze these elements of
$\pi_3\mathsf{Emb}_\partial(I,M)$ using embedding calculus by studying the
induced map from the embedding space to ``Taylor approximations""
$T_k\mathsf{Emb}_\partial(I,M)$. We develop a diagrammatic framework inspired
by cubical $\omega$-groupoids to depict $G(p,q,r)$ and related homotopies. We
use this framework extensively in Chapter 4 to show explicitly that $G(p,q,r)$
is trivial in $\pi_3T_3\mathsf{Emb}_\partial(I,M)$ (however, we conjecture that
it is non-trivial in $\pi_3T_4\mathsf{Emb}_\partial(I,M)$). In Chapter 5 we use
the Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence for homotopy groups of cosimplicial spaces
to show that the rational homotopy group
$\pi^{\mathbb{Q}}_3\mathsf{Emb}_\partial(I,S^1 \times B^3)$ is $\mathbb{Q}$.
This thesis extends work by Budney and Gabai which proves analogous results for
$\pi_2\mathsf{Emb}_\partial(I,M)$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02111v1,2511.02111v1,GT
A Steenrod Square for Link Floer Homology,2025-11-03 19:14:09+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02000v1,"Recently, Manolescu-Sarkar constructed a stable homotopy type for link Floer
homology, which uses grid homology and accounts for all domains that do not
pass through a specific square. We explicitly give the framings of the
lower-dimensional moduli spaces of the Manolescu-Sarkar construction as well as
the more general moduli spaces corresponding to the full grid. Though in the
latter case the stable homotopy type is not known, the explicit framings are
enough to construct a framed 1-flow category, a construction by
Lobb-Orson-Sch\""utz which contains enough information to find the second
Steenrod square. Finally, we find an algorithm for computing the second
Steenrod square for all versions of grid homology coming from the full grid.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02000v1,2511.02000v1,GT

we associate to any non-degenerate contact manifold a flow category based on
Reeb orbits and moduli spaces of pseudo-holomorphic buildings. The construction
lifts contact homology and is natural in the sense that to any exact symplectic
cobordism we can associate a flow bimodule between the flow categories of its
ends.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01821v1,2511.01821v1,GT
On discrete symmetries of the cube of smoothings,2025-11-03 10:57:09+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01446v1,"We study the Khovanov complex of closed piecewise linear curves in the
3-space. A polygonal link representation endows the cube of resolutions with an
additional combinatorial structure. The set of symmetries preserving this

other group-theoretic invariants of links.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01446v1,2511.01446v1,GT
Quasi-holomorphic maps,2025-11-03 09:49:46+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01401v1,"We introduce a new notion, called quasi-holomorphic maps. These are real
smooth maps equipped with a structure that imitates the singularities and
singularity stratifications of holomorphic maps on the source and target
manifolds, although the manifolds themselves carry no global complex
structures. Some important examples of quasi-holomorphic maps are branched
coverings and links of finitely determined holomorphic map germs. We show a
Pontryagin--Thom type construction for a ``universal'' quasi-holomorphic map
with prescribed multisingularities, from which all such maps can be induced,
and a similar result for maps with prescribed singularities. Applying this, we
prove that the Thom polynomials of holomorphic singularities determine the
cohomology classes represented by the singular loci of not only holomorphic but
quasi-holomorphic maps as well. As another application we define the cobordism
groups of quasi-holomorphic maps with restricted multisingularities, whose
classifying space was given by the above construction. We completely compute
the free parts of these cobordism groups and in some special cases also obtain
results on their torsion parts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01401v1,2511.01401v1,GT
Bounded domains in the 3-dimensional space,2025-11-03 06:53:25+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01278v1,"We study the shapes of compact connected 3-manifolds with connected smooth
boundary in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space $\boldsymbol{R}^3$. We call them
bounded domains. Since compact connected surfaces in $\boldsymbol{R}^3$ bound
unique bounded domains, the objects are the same as compact connected surfaces
in $\boldsymbol{R}^3$. To understand their shapes, we use the Morse height
functions $F: M\to \boldsymbol{R}$ which are the orthogonal projections from
the bounded domains $M$ to lines, and their Reeb graphs $\mathcal{R}_F$ and
$\mathcal{R}_{F|\partial M}$ which are obtained by identifying connected
components of level sets of maps to points. We introduce the weighted Reeb
graphs $\mathcal{R}_F^w$ and the weighted indexed Reeb graphs
$\mathcal{R}_F^{wi}$. We investigate whether a bounded domain admits a Morse
height function $F$ with the weighted Reeb graphs $\mathcal{R}_F^w$ with small
weight. We show that if the weights are less than 2. $M$ can be deformed by
isotopy to an embedded handlebody. The original question which lead us to
investigate bounded domains is the following question: ""Can the domain $M$ be
isotoped so that, for every point of the boundary $\partial M$, there is a ray
from the point which intersects the domain $M$ only at the end point?"" In other
words, ""Can $M$ be isotoped to $\iota(M)$ so that every point of $\partial
\iota (M)$ is visible from the infinity?"" Under the minNCP hypothesis, we show
that if a bounded domain $M$ can be isotoped to $\iota(M)$ so that every point
of the boundary is visible from the infinity, then $M$ is an embedded
handlebody. Here the minNCP hypothesis asserts that, if $M$ is isotopic to a
visible $\iota(M)$, $\iota(M)$ can be taken so that $z:\iota(M)\to
\boldsymbol{R}$ is a Morse height function with minimum number of critical
points in the isotopy class of the embedding $M\subset \boldsymbol{R}^3$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01278v1,2511.01278v1,GT
A local $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$-action on odd Khovanov homology,2025-11-02 14:14:51+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00947v1,"We show that odd Khovanov homology carries an action of the super Lie algebra
$\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$, given extra choice of markings on the link. Moreover, we
show that this action arises from an action on super $\mathfrak{gl}_{2}$-foams,
in the extended-TQFT framework developed by the second author and Vaz; in
particular, it extends to tangles. Finally, we relate the action to torsion
$\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ in pretzel links $P(n,n,-n)$. In particular, this
shows that all torsion can appear in odd Khovanov homology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00947v1,2511.00947v1,GT

Constraints on Lefschetz fibrations with four-dimensional fibers from Seiberg-Witten theory,2025-11-01 15:53:29+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00601v1,"We establish constraints on the topology of smooth Lefschetz fibrations with
$4$-dimensional fibers, by studying the family Bauer-Furuta invariant. To

Seiberg-Witten moduli spaces using the local index theorem by Bismut-Freed.
Using this, we deduce new obstructions to the smooth isotopy to the identity
for compositions of Dehn twists on $(-2)$-spheres in closed $4$-manifolds. We
obtain several applications: (1) We exhibit the first examples of closed
simply-connected symplectic $4$-manifolds admitting Torelli symplectomorphisms
which are smoothly non-trivial. In particular, their symplectic Torelli mapping
class group is not generated by squared Dehn-Seidel twists on Lagrangian
spheres -- providing a negative answer to a question of Donaldson. (2) We
provide the first examples of irreducible closed $4$-manifolds (both symplectic
